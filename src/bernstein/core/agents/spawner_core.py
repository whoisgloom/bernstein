# fast-exit probes (``CLIAdapter._probe_fast_exit`` in adapters/base.py)
# raise a ``SpawnError``/``RateLimitError`` whose message embeds only the
# LAST LINE of the runner's log (``tail_lines[-1]``). In the D2 MiniMax
# incident, the openai_agents runner actually died on
# ``BadRequestError: 400 ... does not support max tokens > 196608``, but
# the log's last line was a benign, unrelated SDK tracing warning
# (``OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export``) - the real error
# sat further up in the per-session runtime log. That masking happened
# across 7 run attempts before the real defect was found by hand.

# Fixing the extraction inside adapters/base.py is out of scope for this
# change (file-ownership boundary - see PR description), so this

# <session_id>.log`` - see e.g. adapters/openai_agents.py's ``log_path``
# construction) rather than trusting the already-truncated exception

    """Build the full agent prompt from role template + tasks + context.

    Uses the Jinja2-style template renderer for proper variable substitution.
    Falls back to simple string concatenation if rendering fails.  When the
    template renderer fallback is used, the agency catalog is checked for
    roles not covered by templates/roles/.

    If *catalog_system_prompt* is provided it replaces the built-in role
    template entirely, so the spawner can inject catalog-defined personas.

    Args:
        tasks: Batch of 1-3 tasks (all same role).
        templates_dir: Root of templates/roles/ directory.
        workdir: Project working directory.
        agency_catalog: Optional Agency agent catalog for extended roles.
        spawner_config: Optional spawner config used for prompt-side limits.
        catalog_system_prompt: Optional system prompt from a catalog agent.
            When set, this replaces the template/role-based role prompt.
        context_builder: Optional TaskContextBuilder for rich context injection.
        bulletin_summary: Optional recent bulletin activity to inject as a
            team-awareness section. Empty string means no section is added.
        task_graph: Optional task graph for injecting typed-edge predecessor
            context (INFORMS / TRANSFORMS outputs).
        max_turns: Optional best-effort resolution of the agent's tool-use
            turn cap, known at the spawn call site (see
            ``AgentSpawner.spawn_for_tasks``'s resolution logic just before
            this function is called). When present, renders a static
            "## Turn budget" section so the model self-polices instead of
            exploring until ``MaxTurnsExceeded`` fires with zero output
            (see work/bernstein/m27-nudge-plan.md, Approach C MINIMAL).
            ``None`` means the caller could not resolve a value at
            prompt-build time (e.g. SDK default applies, or the resolved
            adapter doesn't use a turn-capped runner) - the section is
            skipped in that case, not rendered with a placeholder.

    Returns:
        Tuple of ``(prompt, receipt)`` where *prompt* is the complete prompt
        string ready for the CLI adapter (cache block annotation is available
        via mark_cacheable_prefix() vs dynamic, so adapters can apply
        provider-specific caching) and *receipt* is the per-section content
        receipt for the context actually included.

        Aliasing defence: the registry is the source of truth.  If an
        operator registers an alias name with the original tool's caps
        (a structural choice they own), that alias contributes to the
        trifecta calculation just like the canonical name.  If they

        auditors can replay every blocked spawn attempt without parsing

        """Best-effort probe: does the adapter for this spawn honour sampling?

        Used to decide whether mode-profile sampling params may be folded
        into the per-spawn config. Only adapters that declare
        :attr:`AdapterCapability.SUPPORTS_SAMPLING_PARAMS` accept them; for
        any other adapter the spawn path's
        :func:`ensure_sampling_params_supported` gate would refuse the
        spawn, so injecting profile defaults there would break otherwise
        valid runs.

        ``provider_name`` is the per-role/per-spawn provider resolved by the
        caller (``_apply_sampling_overrides`` passes the same ``provider_name``
        that ``spawn_for_tasks`` computed from ``role_model_policy``/task
        ``cli`` and fed into ``_resolve_routing``). Passing it through to
        :meth:`_infer_adapter_name_for_provider` is what makes this probe
        target the adapter that will ACTUALLY spawn the role - e.g.
        ``openai_agents`` for a role pinned via ``role_model_policy.<role>.
        provider: openai_agents`` - instead of always resolving from
        ``provider_name=None``, which silently falls back to the *primary*
        adapter (``self._adapter``, e.g. ``claude`` from ``cli: auto``).
        That primary-adapter fallback was the root cause of the mode-profile
        sampling fold (and, before PR3's unconditional role-policy fold, any
        role-scoped sampling override) being silently skipped whenever the
        primary adapter did not declare ``SUPPORTS_SAMPLING_PARAMS`` even
        though the per-role adapter did (see the D2 OpenRouter KILL-NOTE).
        ``provider_name=None`` (the default) preserves the previous
        primary-adapter behavior for call sites that have no role context.

        The probe prefers an already-known adapter instance - the default
        adapter or an already-cached one - to avoid perturbing the failover
        loop's own adapter resolution/caching. But the per-role adapter is
        frequently NOT yet cached at this point in ``spawn_for_tasks``
        (this gate runs before the spawn loop's own
        :meth:`_get_adapter_by_name` call), which is exactly the scenario
        that silently starved the mode-profile fold: a cache-miss used to
        fall straight through to ``self._adapter`` (the primary adapter),
        never actually checking the per-role adapter's capability at all.
        To fix that without perturbing the failover loop, an uncached probe
        instantiates the resolved adapter class directly via
        :func:`bernstein.adapters.registry.get_adapter` - a plain
        constructor call, not :meth:`_get_adapter_by_name` (which enforces
        ``role_adapter_policy`` and writes an audit-log entry as a side
        effect) - checks its capability, and discards the instance without
        adding it to ``self._adapter_cache``. Any failure to construct the
        probe instance (unknown adapter name, missing optional dependency,
        etc.) is swallowed and treated as "does not support sampling", the
        conservative choice that preserves today's behavior.

        Two opt-in sources feed the per-spawn ``mcp_config`` slots the
        adapter manifest reads (see :data:`SAMPLING_PARAM_KEYS`):

        1. ``role_model_policy[role]`` - the per-role
           :class:`~bernstein.core.config.config_schema.RoleModelPolicyEntry`
           parsed from ``bernstein.yaml``: ``base_url``/``api_key_env`` (the
           OpenAI-compatible endpoint override; ``api_key_env`` was already
           validated at parse time against the fail-closed credential
           allowlist) AND, since PR3, ``temperature``/``top_p``/``top_k``/
           ``max_tokens``/``extra_params``. All of these are explicit
           operator config, so they forward unconditionally; the spawn
           path's capability gate (:func:`ensure_sampling_params_supported`)
           still guards whether the target adapter actually honours them.
        2. The resolved :class:`ModeProfile`'s deterministic sampling params
           (``temperature``, ``top_p``, ``top_k``, ``max_tokens``) via
           :func:`apply_mode_to_spawn`. These are implicit defaults, so they
           are folded in only when the target adapter declares
           ``SUPPORTS_SAMPLING_PARAMS`` - otherwise the capability gate
           would refuse an otherwise valid spawn.

        Precedence is: an explicit value already present in ``mcp_config``
        (operator-set) wins over a role-policy value, which wins over a
        mode-profile value. Absent config leaves ``mcp_config`` unchanged,
        so a run without any of these keys is byte-identical to before.
        (PR3 note: this is the function the design doc referred to as
        ``_fold_role_and_mode_sampling_params_into_mcp_config`` - it was
        already implemented and named ``_apply_sampling_overrides`` when
        this PR started; see the PR3 report for that drift.)

        The merge is deterministic: it reads only the parsed config, the
        selected model id, and the task metadata - no wall-clock or random
        input - so two operators with identical state build identical
        manifests.

        A spawn is refused on hash drift (a cloud storage sink added, a catalog
        re-enabled, a role repointed) *or* a live violation (an endpoint whose
        certification receipt was revoked without a config change, which leaves
        the posture hash unchanged). The signed refusal record re-verifies under
        ``bernstein audit verify``, so the divergence is caught at spawn time and
        evidenced on the chain rather than surfacing at audit time.

        The gate arms on either of two independent signals, so no single
        environment edit disables it: the sovereign marker *pair*, or the mere
        presence of a signed attestation in the workspace. A workspace that has
        been attested sovereign stays gated even if a child process is launched
        with the markers stripped -- the receipt on disk is the durable claim,
        the environment is not.

        Raises:
            PostureDriftRefusal: On drift, a live violation, a half-set marker
                pair, an unreadable config, or a missing / untrusted
                attestation. Deliberately not a ``SpawnError`` so the
                per-provider failover loop never retries it -- a hard stop.
