"""Bootstrap orchestration: coordinate startup, task planning, and agent spawning.

This module orchestrates the full bootstrap flow: parsing seed, starting server,
and spawning agents. It imports lower-level startup logic from server_launch.py
and preflight checks from preflight.py.

Entry points:
- bootstrap_from_seed() - read bernstein.yaml and launch
- bootstrap_from_goal() - quick launch from inline goal string

    it is permanent, because nothing else recreates ``spawner.pid`` once it is
    gone. ``bernstein doctor --fix`` / ``bernstein status --fix``
    (``cli/commands/status_cmd.py::_fix_stale_pids``) deletes precisely the
    pidfile of a process that has already crashed, so "crashed, and then its

    Teardown is NOT a reason to withhold a restart here, because this process is

    ``watchdog.pid`` FIRST and only removes pidfiles at the end of
    ``_phase_cleanup``. The supervisor is already dead before teardown deletes
    anything. ``run_watchdog`` still checks for teardown before calling this,

    run-completion verdict reads, so the two subsystems cannot disagree about
    what "gone" means. Its job here is the reverse of its job in the CLI: it
    prevents an unrelated process that inherited a recycled pid from passing as
    our live orchestrator and thereby SUPPRESSING a restart the run needs.
    ``LIVENESS_ALIVE`` is the only value that withholds one.

    A dead orchestrator is therefore a RECOVERABLE state, not a terminal one,
    for as long as this loop is running with restart budget left. Anything else
    that wants to conclude the orchestrator will not come back has to outwait
    ``poll_s`` -- which is why that period is a shared constant
    (``process_utils.WATCHDOG_POLL_S``) rather than a private default here, and
    why the CLI's run-completion verdict sizes its confirmation window from it.

    The loop stands down only on positive teardown evidence (see
    :func:`_supervisor_should_stand_down`). Everything else recovers, including
    a supervised process whose pidfile has gone missing.
