"""Salvage uncommitted agent work before worktree cleanup.

When an agent fails, is killed, or its worktree is otherwise reaped while it
still has dirty state, ``git worktree remove --force`` silently discards the
work.  Diffs and untracked files are lost - not even ``git reflog`` can
recover them because no ref ever pointed at the work.

This module adds a lightweight pre-cleanup step that captures any dirty
state into a durable location *before* the worktree is removed:

1. ``salvage/<session-id>`` branch created in the repo with a WIP commit
   containing every tracked modification + untracked file (except
   ``.gitignore`` matches).  Preferred path - the branch is easy to inspect
   with ``git log`` / ``git diff`` and ``git checkout``.
2. If the branch cannot be pushed to ``origin`` (no remote, network error,
   etc.) a filesystem fallback writes the diff + untracked file inventory
   to ``.sdd/runtime/salvage/<session-id>-<timestamp>/``.

The functions here are intentionally best-effort: any exception raised by
a salvage step is logged and swallowed so that cleanup itself never fails
because of a salvage failure - we'd rather lose the salvage than block the
orchestrator.
