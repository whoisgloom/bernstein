    """Queue a retry for a failed task with model/effort escalation.

    First retry bumps effort one level (low->medium->high->max), keeps model.
    Second retry escalates model (haiku->sonnet->opus) and resets effort to high.

    Model escalation applies only when the operator did not name a model. A
    per-role ``role_model_policy.<role>.model`` or a run-level ``--model``
    (threaded in as ``run_pinned_model``) is carried through every retry
    verbatim - see :func:`_operator_pinned_model` and #4274.

    Args:
        task: The failed task to potentially retry.
        retried_task_ids: Set of task IDs this path is finished with --
            retried, or exhausted and therefore terminal (mutated in-place).
        max_task_retries: Maximum retries allowed.
        client: httpx client.
        server_url: Task server base URL.
        quarantine: QuarantineStore instance.
        workdir: Optional repo root used to inspect the failed agent log.
        session_id: Optional failed session ID for failure-context extraction.
        role_model_policy: Optional ``AgentSpawner.role_model_policy`` snapshot,
            read for its per-role ``model`` pin.
        run_pinned_model: Optional run-level ``--model`` pin
            (``AgentSpawner.default_model``).

    Returns:
        True if a retry task was created, False otherwise.

    """Re-queue a task for retry, or fail it permanently if max retries reached.

    Reads the current retry count from the typed ``task.retry_count`` field -
    the single source of truth. Title and description are copied
    verbatim; no ``[RETRY N]`` / ``[retry:N]`` markers are written.  If the
    typed counter is below ``min(task.max_retries, dynamic_limit(reason))`` a
    new open task is created with ``retry_count`` incremented; otherwise the
    task is moved to the Dead Letter Queue and failed with a
    ``"Max retries exceeded"`` reason.

    Planning-role retries (``task.role == "manager"``) get one extra check
    before the new task is left open: if a sibling planning task sharing the
    same decomposition lineage has already reached ``done``/``closed`` (see
    ``_find_done_planning_sibling``), the retry is created and then
    immediately cancelled with a reason instead of left claimable -- two
    managers decomposing the same goal doubles every downstream task
    (#4309). Worker retries are unaffected.

    Args:
        task_id: ID of the task to retry or fail.
        reason: Human-readable reason for the failure / retry.
        client: httpx client.
        server_url: Task server base URL.
        max_task_retries: Orchestrator-wide retry ceiling.  The effective
            limit is ``min(task.max_retries, dynamic_limit(reason))``.
        retried_task_ids: Set of already-retried task IDs (mutated in-place).
        tasks_snapshot: Optional pre-fetched tasks snapshot to avoid an
            extra HTTP round-trip when the task is already in cache.
        workdir: Orchestrator working directory.  When provided, tasks that
            exhaust their retry budget are also enqueued into the Dead Letter
            Queue under ``<workdir>/.sdd/runtime/dlq.jsonl``.
            Callers without a workdir (e.g. ad-hoc scripts or legacy tests)
            fall back to the historical behaviour of plain failure.
        role_model_policy: Optional ``AgentSpawner.role_model_policy`` snapshot.
            When the retrying task's role has a non-Claude ``provider``/``model``
            pinned here, retry escalation stamps ``effort``/``max_output_tokens``
            only and leaves ``model`` alone instead of stamping a Claude tier
            name ("opus"/"sonnet") that is meaningless to that adapter. Callers
            that omit this (e.g. legacy tests, ad-hoc scripts) get the
            historical Claude-tier-name-always behavior, which is correct for
            Claude-only runs and was never wrong until a non-Claude adapter
            entered the picture.
        default_adapter_name: The spawner's default adapter name (e.g.
            ``AgentSpawner.default_adapter_name``), used as the fallback
            Claude-compatibility check when the retrying role has no
            role_model_policy entry of its own.
        run_pinned_model: The run-level model pin (``bernstein run --model``),
            which the orchestrator threads in from
            ``AgentSpawner.default_model``. Together with
            ``role_model_policy.<role>.model`` this is the second of the two
            routes by which an operator names a model; both are collapsed by
            :func:`_operator_pinned_model` and both are honoured verbatim by
            retry escalation (#4274).
        transport_failure: The agent exited without consuming a token, so it
            never reached the model and never attempted the task. Such a retry
            does not decrement the ordinary retry budget; it is counted
            separately against ``_MAX_TRANSPORT_FAILURE_RETRIES`` with its own
            backoff, and once that ceiling is reached it is charged like any
            other failure so a transport fault that never clears still
            terminates (#4275).

    Root cause (Bug 1, 2026-07-02, evidence in
    ``work/bernstein/proofs/d2/claim-loop-evidence``): the original call site
    sent one CAS claim attempt and, on 409, gave up for the current tick --
    but ``batches`` is recomputed fresh every tick from ``fetch_all_tasks``,
    and if the task's server-side state never actually changes (e.g. a
    dependency check or a stale file-ownership lock from a dead agent keeps
    failing the claim for a reason that has nothing to do with the version),
    the exact same stale ``expected_version`` gets resubmitted every tick,
    forever. Server log evidence: 144 consecutive identical
    ``POST /tasks/109ba3616f03/claim?expected_version=1`` -> 409 responses
    from one session against one task across an entire run, with the worker
    for that task never spawning.

    On every 409 this now:
      1. Re-GETs the task to discover its CURRENT version/status.
      2. If the task is gone (404) or has reached a terminal status
         (done/closed/failed/cancelled/abandoned) -> stop; there is nothing
         left to claim.
      3. If another session now holds a non-open claim on it -> stop and
         move on; retrying cannot help.
      4. Otherwise (still OPEN) -> retry with the freshly observed version,
         whether or not it actually moved -- a same-version 409 means some
         OTHER precondition (role mismatch, unmet dependency, file-ownership
         overlap) is blocking the claim, and that also deserves a few
         bounded retries rather than an infinite tight loop.
    Retries within one call are capped at ``_CLAIM_CONFLICT_MAX_ATTEMPTS``.

    Every attempt is logged at INFO with task_id, version sent, response
    code, the current version/status discovered on re-fetch, and the
    decision taken -- so a repeat of this bug shows up as readable log
    lines instead of a silent multi-hundred-line loop.

    Returns:
        ``(response, None)`` on a successful (non-409) response -- caller
        must still check ``response.status_code`` for 404/5xx as before.
