"""Audit chain helpers for cross-subsystem event recording.

This module exposes :class:`AuditChainStore`, a thin facade over
:class:`bernstein.core.security.audit.AuditLog` that surfaces the
``prev_chain_digest`` (the HMAC of the most recent event) to callers
that need to embed it inside an event payload (for example
``multimodal.attach``).

The module also defines additive event-type constants used by
subsystems that emit structured records into the HMAC-chained log.
New event types should be added below as ``EVENT_<UPPER_SNAKE>``
string constants -- never edit existing entries.

Concurrent-edit policy
----------------------
Sibling agents may extend this module with additional event-type
constants and helper functions; the ``AuditChainStore`` class itself
is treated as the stable surface. Helpers MUST:

* Accept the chain instance, not import it as a singleton.
* Call ``chain.log_with_prev_digest`` so that ``prev_chain_digest``
  is captured in ``details`` before the HMAC is computed.
* Never mutate existing event-type constants.

# IMPORTANT: never modify or remove existing constants below. Add new
# constants only. Sibling agents may concurrently append to this list.

#: Issue #1797 -- emitted whenever an operator attaches an image to a
#: worker via ``bernstein run --attach`` (or the matching task YAML
#: ``attachments`` field). The event records the bytes' SHA-256, MIME
#: type, the requesting worker, the turn sequence number, the worktree
#: id, the operator install identity signature, and the previous chain
#: digest.
EVENT_MULTIMODAL_ATTACH = "multimodal.attach"

#: Issue #2242 -- emitted whenever the compaction sensitive-content gate
#: redacts a credential-shaped span, refuses a compaction outright, or
#: suppresses a rule via an operator allowlist entry. The event records
#: the task id, the rule id, the action taken, and the SHA-256 of the
#: offending span -- never the span content itself.
EVENT_COMPACTION_SENSITIVE_GATE = "compaction.sensitive_gate"

#: Issue #2246 -- emitted once per context compaction (proactive or
#: reactive). The event carries the full compaction receipt: pre/post
#: context SHA-256, token counts, validator verdicts, retry count, and
#: gate-outcome references. See
#: :mod:`bernstein.core.tokens.compaction_receipt` for the payload
#: builder and the verification helper that fails a run when a
#: journaled compaction lacks a chain-verifiable receipt.
EVENT_COMPACTION_RECEIPT = "compaction.receipt"

#: Issue #2245 -- emitted whenever ``bernstein cost profile-report``
#: writes a content-addressed per-profile cost report. The event
#: records the report's SHA-256, the ledger line-hash range the report
#: was computed from, and the previous chain digest, so a third party
#: holding the ledger can recompute the report byte-identically and
#: check it against the chain.
EVENT_COST_PROFILE_REPORT = "cost.profile_report"

#: Issue #2918 -- emitted the first time a run's spend ledger crosses its
#: soft or hard budget cap. Until this event existed the halt survived
#: only as a ``logger.warning`` line, so "this run stopped because of its
#: budget" was not reconstructable from the tamper-evident chain. The
#: event records the band that tripped, the spend and the cap as integer
#: nano-USD, and the previous chain digest.
EVENT_BUDGET_HALT = "cost.budget_halt"

#: Issue #2247 -- emitted whenever ``bernstein eval ab`` writes a
#: content-addressed profile comparison artifact. The event records the
#: artifact's SHA-256 plus the suite and profile-addendum hashes that
#: pin exactly what was compared, and the previous chain digest, so a
#: verifier holding the suite and the spend ledger can recompute the
#: artifact byte-identically and check it against the chain.
EVENT_EVAL_AB_COMPARISON = "eval.ab_comparison"

#: Issue #2606 -- emitted for every action a third-party autonomous browser /
#: computer-use agent decides on against a live UI. The event is the per-action
#: replay manifest: it carries the action anchor
#: (``sha256(prev_anchor, observation_hash, action)``), the prior anchor, the
#: pre-action screenshot's CAS SHA-256, the normalised DOM/accessibility digest,
#: the observation hash, the canonicalised action (kind / target / value
#: digest), the signed lineage entry hash, the worker identity, the worktree
#: id, and the previous chain digest. Mirrors ``multimodal.attach`` but for the
#: outbound action stream; a replay walks these events, re-hashes the stored
#: bytes, recomputes each anchor, and compares against the signed lineage head.
EVENT_COMPUTER_USE_ACTION = "computer_use.action"

#: Issue #2249 -- emitted once per applied role-template compression
#: (``bernstein templates compress``). The event carries the full
#: compression receipt: role, pre/post role-template directory digests,
#: token estimates, validator verdicts, adapter and model, per-file
#: content hashes, and the previous chain digest. See
#: :mod:`bernstein.core.tokens.template_compression` for the payload
#: builder and the verification helper.
EVENT_TEMPLATE_COMPRESSION_RECEIPT = "template.compression.receipt"

#: Issue #2249 -- emitted when ``bernstein templates restore`` reverses
#: a receipted compression byte-identically. The event references the
#: compression's correlation id and the verified pre/post role-template
#: directory digests.
EVENT_TEMPLATE_COMPRESSION_RESTORE = "template.compression.restore"

#: Issue #2298 -- emitted whenever a cross-session memory write (or
#: forget tombstone) is appended to the tamper-evident memory chain. The
#: event records the memory-chain entry hash, the lineage-spine
#: ``source_hash`` the record anchors to, the identity scope and
#: namespace, the actor, the originating run and step, and the entry
#: kind (``write`` or ``tombstone``) -- never the remembered claim
#: content. See :mod:`bernstein.core.memory.chain`.
EVENT_MEMORY_WRITE = "memory.write"

#: Issue #2301 -- emitted once per skill install. The event carries the
#: skill install receipt: the installed content hash, the authorising
#: manifest hash, the install id, and the spine anchor (the entry hash of
#: the receipt row in the install lineage spine). A verifier holding the
#: spine can recompute the anchor byte-identically and confirm the install
#: is chain-attested rather than registry-declared.
EVENT_SKILL_INSTALL_RECEIPT = "skill.install_receipt"

#: Issue #2301 -- emitted whenever a skill participates in a run. The event
#: binds the skill's content hash to the run journal head (the run's spine
#: head hash) so a later provenance query can recompute usage from verified
#: journal heads rather than from a mutable counter.
EVENT_SKILL_USAGE = "skill.usage"

#: Issue #2527 -- emitted whenever an install, doctor check, or spawn-side
#: injection refuses a skill because a transparency (inclusion / consistency)
#: proof failed or a signed revocation covers it. The chain-anchored refusal is
#: independently verifiable: an operator can prove a known-bad version was
#: contained, when, and why. See
#: :mod:`bernstein.core.skills.catalog.transparency` and
#: :mod:`bernstein.core.skills.catalog.revocation`.
EVENT_SKILL_VERIFICATION_REFUSAL = "skill.verification_refusal"

#: Issue #2306 -- emitted whenever a payment is authorized under a signed
#: spending mandate. The event carries the consent receipt binding
#: ``{mandate_hash, authorized_tool_calls_hash, settlement_ref,
#: journal_entry_hash}`` -- the journal entry hash anchors the receipt in the
#: mandate lineage spine so a verifier can recompute "this payment was
#: authorized by this exact intent" offline. Only hashes and the public
#: settlement reference are recorded -- never a payment credential.
EVENT_MANDATE_CONSENT_RECEIPT = "mandate.consent_receipt"

#: Issue #2306 -- emitted whenever a spending mandate is revoked. The event
#: records the revoked mandate hash and reason so an auditor can prove, from
#: the chain alone, that authority was withdrawn at a time; subsequent
#: actions under the mandate are refused.
EVENT_MANDATE_REVOCATION = "mandate.revocation"

#: Issue #2297 -- emitted when an operator resolves an approval over the
#: live event stream. The event anchors the decision to the exact run
#: journal entry the stream projected at decision time (the journal index
#: and its Merkle ``event_hash``), so a verifier can prove the approval was
#: made against the executed thread rather than a divergent view. The event
#: records the run id, the journal index, the entry hash, the decision, the
#: operator install signature, and the worktree id -- never diff content.
EVENT_THREAD_APPROVAL = "thread.approval"

#: Issue #2300 -- emitted whenever a signed OTel GenAI span set is projected
#: from a run's event journal. The event records the run id, the journal head
#: the projection anchors to, the derived OTLP trace id, the span count, and
#: the sha256 of the canonical signed span set. A verifier holding the journal
#: can reproject byte-identically and confirm the exported spans are a faithful
#: projection of the chain rather than free-standing telemetry -- never the
#: span attribute payloads themselves.
EVENT_OTEL_PROJECTION = "otel.projection"

#: Issue #2295 -- emitted once per ``bernstein fork --from-step``. The event
#: pins the fork lineage into the HMAC chain: the parent run id, the fork
#: step index, the content-addressed snapshot commit sha resumed at that
#: step, and the new child run id. Because the snapshot sha is the git
#: commit the child worktree was checked out from, a verifier holding the
#: parent journal and the snapshot ref can confirm the fork branched from
#: exactly the recorded step (a tampered ref no longer matches the sha).
EVENT_FORK_SNAPSHOT = "replay.fork_snapshot"

#: Issue #2294 -- emitted whenever a maker-checker or judge-panel gate produces
#: a signed adjudication record. The event mirrors the record's hashes and its
#: journal anchor into the chain so an operator can confirm, from the chain
#: alone, that a gate verdict bound the claimed inputs, rubric, and panel to a
#: named journal entry. Only hashes and the anchor are recorded -- never the raw
#: diff or rubric content.
EVENT_GATE_ADJUDICATION = "gate.adjudication"

#: Issue #2296 -- emitted whenever a signed pull-request review receipt is
#: anchored in the review lineage spine. The event mirrors the receipt's four
#: bound hashes (``issue_hash``, ``plan_hash``, ``journal_head``, ``diff_hash``),
#: the verdict, and the spine ``journal_entry_hash`` so an operator can prove,
#: from the audit chain alone, that a review receipt was emitted for a PR
#: linking issue to diff -- never the diff or issue body itself.
EVENT_REVIEW_RECEIPT = "review.receipt"

#: Issue #2307 -- emitted for every stateless MCP call. The stateless spec
#: revision removes the ``initialize`` handshake and ``Mcp-Session-Id``, so any
#: request can land on any server instance and the protocol no longer provides
#: cross-call ordering. This event anchors the call's continuity in the audit
#: chain instead of a session store: it records the run id, the MCP method, the
#: ordered call index, the content-derived W3C trace/span ids, the run journal
#: head the call was recorded against, and -- on a cache hit -- the content hash
#: of the producing run. A verifier can recompute the ordering from verified
#: chain entries rather than trusting a session id.
EVENT_MCP_STATELESS_CALL = "mcp.stateless_call"

#: Issue #7937 -- emitted whenever an MCP server's declared tool set changes
#: across a run boundary or on a subsequent invocation against the same
#: server.  The event records the server name, the previous tool-list digest
#: (``sha256:<hex>`` of the sorted canonical tool-name list; ``None`` for
#: first contact), the current digest, the set of added and removed tool
#: names (each a sorted tuple), and the current tool count.  A verifier can
#: reconstruct the exact moment each server drifted and bind the drift to a
#: named run and journal head, so the chain alone proves which server
#: gained or lost which tools.
EVENT_MCP_CAPABILITY_DRIFT = "mcp.capability_drift"

#: Issue #3610 (slice 1) -- emitted when a run's semantic code graph digest
#: is anchored in the HMAC chain. This event records the graph digest, the
#: run id, the graph version, the source/indexed file counts, the unparsed
#: file count, the inferred and extracted edge counts, and the previous chain
#: digest so a verifier can prove the run admitted exactly this graph state
#: rather than a divergent or stale view of the repository. A verifier holding
#: the graph digest and its run id can recompute the canonical graph
#: byte-identically (via :func:`graph_from_document`) and re-derive the event
#: to confirm the run had the graph it claims.
EVENT_CODE_GRAPH_ANCHORED = "code_graph.anchored"

#: Issue #2308 -- emitted whenever a deterministic outer-plan node delegates
#: mechanical execution to a native subagent (Claude Code, Codex, ...). The
#: event binds the plan-node hash (a pure function of the outer plan, so it is
#: identical across replays) to the native result's content hash and the run
#: journal entry the delegation was anchored at. A verifier can prove, from the
#: chain alone, that the cross-worker DAG crossed a delegation boundary at a
#: named node and anchored a specific (stochastic) result, without the record
#: exposing the native result payload itself.
EVENT_SUBAGENT_DELEGATION = "subagent.delegation"

#: Issue #2302 -- emitted once per recurring-goal schedule fire projection.
#: A recurring goal fire is a pure projection of ``(schedule_id, fire_time,
#: last_state)`` onto a canonical task graph; this event anchors the fire in
#: the HMAC chain by recording ``{schedule_id, fire_time, last_state_hash,
#: graph_hash}`` plus the lineage-spine ``journal_entry_hash`` the projection
#: was sealed into and the ``trigger_input_hash`` for a webhook / file-change
#: trigger (empty for a plain cron / RRULE fire). A verifier holding the
#: schedule and the fire time can re-run the projection and confirm the
#: recorded ``graph_hash`` byte-identically -- the fire is a hash, not a
#: trigger.
EVENT_SCHEDULE_FIRE_PROJECTION = "schedule.fire_projection"

#: Issue #2299 -- emitted when a stalled worker produces a signed, journal-
#: anchored escalation receipt. The receipt fixes the exact failure window by
#: binding the last N journal entries by their Merkle hash; this event mirrors
#: the receipt's identity into the HMAC-chained audit log so an operator can
#: prove, from the chain alone, that an escalation was emitted for a run and
#: worker with a given recommended action and resume fork point. Only
#: identifiers, the journal head at stall, the window size, the recommended
#: action, and the resume snapshot sha are recorded -- never journal payloads.
EVENT_ESCALATION_RECEIPT = "escalation.receipt"

#: Issue #4855 -- evidence-gated escalation ladder hop. Recorded when a
#: verified failure evidence reference causes the ladder to advance from
#: step N to N+1. The payload binds task id, from/to step, evidence class,
#: evidence digest, and ladder policy version so replay recomputes the hop
#: digest. Never records prompts or model output bodies.
EVENT_ESCALATION_LADDER_HOP = "escalation.ladder_hop"

#: Issue #4855 -- refusal to escalate. Emitted when an advance is requested
#: without a qualifying evidence reference (missing digest or unknown
#: evidence class). The refusal itself is the auditable artefact.
EVENT_ESCALATION_LADDER_REFUSAL = "escalation.ladder_refusal"

#: Issue #4855 -- ladder exhaustion. Final step failed with qualifying
#: evidence; no further hop exists. Downstream policy may consume this.
EVENT_ESCALATION_LADDER_EXHAUSTION = "escalation.ladder_exhaustion"

#: Issue #4855 -- per-task escalation budget stop. Climbing further would
#: exceed ``escalation_budget_usd``; the stop reason is recorded.
EVENT_ESCALATION_LADDER_BUDGET_STOP = "escalation.ladder_budget_stop"

#: Issue #2310 -- emitted whenever a webhook-node receipt is anchored in the
#: webhook-node lineage spine. Inbound receipts bind ``{event_hash,
#: journal_root}`` for a signed inbound event that spawned a run; outbound
#: receipts bind ``{result_hash, journal_head}`` for the signed result the
#: node returned to the calling bus. Mirroring the receipt into the chain lets
#: an operator prove, from the chain alone, that an otherwise-opaque no-code
#: flow step ran under a signed inbound event and produced a signed outbound
#: result. Only hashes and the source label are recorded -- never the webhook
#: body.
EVENT_WEBHOOK_NODE_RECEIPT = "webhook_node.receipt"

#: Issue #2309 -- emitted whenever a governance projection (RBAC access check or
#: per-subject budget check) produces a signed, anchored decision. The event
#: mirrors the decision's ``{subject, action, verdict, inputs_hash,
#: journal_entry_hash}`` into the chain so an operator can confirm, from the
#: chain alone, that a governance decision bound the claimed inputs to a named
#: spine entry. A denied access writes a ``deny`` verdict and a budget breach a
#: ``refuse`` verdict -- both are signed records, not merely logged. Only hashes,
#: the verdict, and the anchor are recorded.
EVENT_GOVERNANCE_DECISION = "governance.decision"

#: Issue #2304 -- emitted whenever an A2A message receipt is anchored in the
#: message-receipt lineage spine. Every inbound/outbound cross-agent message
#: binds ``{message_hash, peer_card_fingerprint, task_uuid, journal_entry_hash}``
#: and the A2A task state it carried. Mirroring the receipt into the chain lets
#: a reviewer prove, from the chain alone, that a cross-agent call happened with
#: the exact inputs claimed, without trusting either agent's logs. Only hashes,
#: the peer fingerprint, the task uuid, and the lifecycle state are recorded --
#: never the message body.
EVENT_A2A_MESSAGE_RECEIPT = "a2a.message_receipt"

#: Issue #2311 -- emitted whenever a typed activity boundary is crossed under the
#: deterministic scheduler, mirroring the run journal's ``activity.result`` entry
#: into the chain. Any agent modality (research, browser/computer-use, data, ops,
#: coding) is dispatched behind a hash-in/hash-out contract; the record binds
#: ``{kind, artifact_hash, evidence_set_hash, terminal_state, reason_code}`` plus
#: the anchoring journal index/hash, so an operator can prove -- from the chain
#: alone -- that a modality-agnostic activity ran with a given evidence set
#: without the record ever exposing the artifact body or the fetched pages. Only
#: hashes, the kind, the terminal state, and the reason code are recorded.
EVENT_ACTIVITY_RESULT = "activity.result"

#: Issue #2362 -- emitted once per sealed verification evidence bundle. A
#: completed task's proof-of-done artefacts (test-runner output, coverage, lint,
#: optional screenshot / recording) are content-addressed and bound into a
#: signed bundle anchored in the evidence lineage spine; this event mirrors the
#: bundle's identity into the HMAC-chained audit log by recording ``{task_id,
#: bundle_hash, item_count, gate_passed, journal_entry_hash}``. A verifier
#: holding the stored blobs can recompute the bundle byte-identically and confirm
#: the evidence is chain-attested rather than merely logged -- never the evidence
#: bytes themselves.
EVENT_EVIDENCE_BUNDLE = "evidence.bundle"

#: Issue #2507 -- emitted whenever an observed provider-side context mutation
#: (compaction boundary or similar opaque state marker surfaced in provider
#: responses) is chained into the run's replay journal. The event mirrors the
#: mutation's content address ``H(kind, before_digest, after_digest,
#: step_index)`` plus the journal head after the entry was chained, so an
#: operator can prove, from the chain alone, that a server-side context
#: rewrite was pinned into the run identity before anything built on the
#: mutated state -- or that a flagged mutation arrived in deterministic mode
#: and the run fails verification closed. Only the kind, the content address,
#: the step index, the flag, and the journal anchor are recorded -- never the
#: mutated context itself.
EVENT_PROVIDER_STATE_MUTATION = "provider.state_mutation"

#: Issue #2358 -- emitted whenever a run's durable work ledger is anchored
#: to its dedicated git ref (``refs/bernstein/work-ledger/<run-id>``). The
#: hash-chained ledger is the resumable task-graph state; this event mirrors
#: each anchor point into the HMAC-chained audit log by recording ``{run_id,
#: head_hash, entry_count, chunk_count, ref, tree_sha}`` plus the previous
#: chain digest. A verifier holding the repository can walk the anchored
#: chain, recompute the head, and confirm the resume point is chain-attested
#: -- the payloads themselves never enter the audit log.
EVENT_WORK_LEDGER_ANCHOR = "work_ledger.anchor"

#: Issue #2359 -- emitted once per checkpointed-retry decision. When a failed
#: task is retried, the scheduler decides warm (resume the recorded native
#: session), fork (branch off the recorded checkpoint), or cold (restart from
#: zero) as a pure function of the adapter's declared capability, the
#: journal-anchored checkpoint reference, and a workspace-hash comparison.
#: The event mirrors ``{task_id, retry_mode, requested_mode, capability,
#: checkpoint_event_hash, checkpoint_journal_index, workspace_match,
#: downgrade_reason, decision_hash, journal_event_hash, journal_entry_hash}``
#: into the chain, so an operator can prove -- from the chain alone -- whether
#: a retry continued a session or restarted cold and why. Only identifiers,
#: hashes, the mode, and the downgrade reason are recorded -- never prompt,
#: gate output, or session content.
EVENT_CHECKPOINT_RETRY = "retry.checkpoint_decision"

#: Issue #2355 -- emitted once per provider-availability routing decision
#: (dispatch-time failover or doctor failover drill). The event records the
#: role, the full fallback chain considered, the recorded probe outcomes, the
#: chosen chain position, the reason the decision fired, and the deterministic
#: decision hash. A verifier holding the same recorded probe set recomputes
#: the routing decision byte-identically and checks it against the chain --
#: two operators replay the same routing.
EVENT_ROUTING_FAILOVER_RECEIPT = "routing.failover_receipt"

#: Issue #2356 -- emitted once per sealed endpoint certification receipt. A
#: conformance run against an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (reachability, chat
#: completion, tool calling, patch format fidelity, timeout behavior, context
#: floor) is bound into an Ed25519-signed receipt anchored in the
#: ``endpoint-certification`` lineage spine run; this event mirrors the seal
#: by recording ``{fingerprint, model, engine, suite_version,
#: transcript_hash, certified_roles, rejected_roles, journal_entry_hash}`` --
#: never the endpoint's responses themselves. Config validation gates
#: merge-critical roles on the receipt, so "certified" is chain-attested
#: rather than a boolean in config.
EVENT_ENDPOINT_CERTIFICATION = "endpoint.certification"

#: Issue #2357 -- emitted whenever the task server accepts a worker mailbox
#: message (``POST /tasks/{id}/messages``). The event records the mailbox
#: journal position (``seq``), the message kind, the sender and its card
#: fingerprint, the body's SHA-256, the mailbox chain ``entry_hash``, and the
#: DLP redaction count -- never the message body. A verifier holding the
#: mailbox journal can recompute every entry and prove the delivered log
#: equals the chain-attested log (see
#: :func:`bernstein.core.communication.task_mailbox.verify_against_chain`).
EVENT_TASK_MAILBOX_MESSAGE = "task.mailbox_message"

#: Issue #2357 -- emitted whenever a claim endpoint hands a task to a worker.
#: The event records the dependency snapshot the claim was granted under: the
#: task id, its declared ``depends_on`` ids (all terminal by construction --
#: the claim API refuses otherwise), the claiming session, the post-claim task
#: version, and which claim path granted it (``next`` / ``by_id`` /
#: ``batch``). Claims become journal entries on the audit chain, so claim
#: eligibility is reconstructable offline instead of remaining an in-memory
#: scheduler decision.
EVENT_TASK_CLAIM_RECEIPT = "task.claim_receipt"

#: Issue #3037 -- the counterpart of :data:`EVENT_TASK_CLAIM_RECEIPT`, emitted
#: whenever a held claim is surrendered: the task returns to the pool
#: (force-claim, reopen, release, restart recovery, node departure) or dies
#: terminally without delivering (fail, cancel, abandon, refuse, and the
#: downstream leg of an abandon cascade). Delivery is not a surrender, so a
#: task reaching ``DONE`` or ``CLOSED`` mints nothing; its claim ends only if
#: it is later reopened, which does mint one. The event records the task id,
#: its role lane, the holder that surrendered it, the post-transition task
#: version, which path ended the claim, the status pair it moved across, and
#: the reason. Without it the chain records every acquisition and no release,
#: so a replay reports a node as still holding a task another node is already
#: executing. With it, folding claim and release receipts in chain order
#: reconstructs the last claimant of every task offline -- see
#: :func:`reconstruct_claim_holders`.
EVENT_TASK_RELEASE_RECEIPT = "task.release_receipt"

#: Issue #2369 -- emitted once per packaged agent-skill / plugin install.
#: When the bundled ``bernstein-run`` skill (or a plugin checkout a host
#: performed) lands in an agent host's skill directory, the install writes a
#: content-addressed receipt anchored in the ``skills`` lineage spine and
#: mirrors ``{skill_hash, manifest_hash, install_id, spine_anchor, host,
#: scope, dest}`` into the chain. A verifier recomputes the installed tree's
#: content address and checks it against the receipt and the spine, so
#: "installed" is chain-attested rather than a directory listing.
EVENT_PLUGIN_INSTALL_RECEIPT = "plugin.install_receipt"

#: Issue #2369 (tail) -- emitted when a packaged install is superseded by an
#: update. The event binds ``prior_skill_hash -> skill_hash`` so the
#: supersession is chain-verifiable: a verifier walks update receipts newest
#: to oldest and lands on the root ``plugin.install_receipt``, proving which
#: content addresses an installed tree passed through and in what order.
EVENT_PLUGIN_UPDATE_RECEIPT = "plugin.update_receipt"

#: Issue #2369 (tail) -- emitted when a packaged skill passes a multi-host
#: conformance sweep: one skill content address is installed into several
#: agent hosts against one bernstein install and the skill's documented
#: self-check contract is replayed per host. The event binds the shared
#: content address, the per-host pass/fail verdicts, and the lineage-spine
#: anchor of the conformance receipt, so "the skill works from N agent CLIs
#: against one install" is chain-verifiable rather than a transient CI log.
EVENT_PLUGIN_CONFORMANCE_RECEIPT = "plugin.conformance_receipt"

#: Issue #2368 -- emitted for every probe of the nightly adapter conformance
#: canary. The event binds the probed adapter, the discovered upstream
#: version, the conformance verdict, and the content hash of the canary
#: receipt into the HMAC chain, so a canary finding (and the last-green
#: table row it attests) is reconstructable and tamper-evident offline
#: rather than living only in a CI log.
EVENT_ADAPTER_CANARY_RECEIPT = "adapter.canary_receipt"

#: Issue #2610 -- emitted for every adapter admission decision, positive and
#: negative alike. The event binds the adapter, the installed upstream version,
#: the pinned contract's content hash, the deterministic golden-transcript
#: replay fingerprint, the conformance run id, and the capabilities the
#: decision grants or withholds. Recording refusals as first-class events is
#: the point: a ``skip`` conformance verdict that leaves no record reads as
#: silent permission, whereas a chain slice carrying refusal events proves
#: offline both which adapters held spawn authority during a window and why
#: every other one did not.
EVENT_ADAPTER_ADMISSION_RECEIPT = "adapter.admission_receipt"

#: Issue #2663 -- emitted when capability-aware routing selects an adapter for a
#: task. The event binds the chosen adapter, the content-addressed capability
#: profile it presented at dispatch, and the task requirements it satisfied.
#: Recording the presented ``profile_hash`` makes profile drift replay-visible:
#: a declaration that changes between two runs shows up as a hash divergence
#: named by the adapter rather than as unexplained behaviour change.
EVENT_ADAPTER_CAPABILITY_SELECTION = "adapter.capability_selection"

#: Issue #4854 -- emitted when an opt-in ``tier_models`` mapping selects a
#: model from a pure task-tier classification. Records the tier, policy
#: version, and feature-vector digest so replay recomputes the decision and
#: names a changed ``tier_policy_version`` as a divergence. The reserved
#: ``error`` marker is recorded when the classifier raises at the call site.
EVENT_TASK_TIER_DECISION = "task.tier_decision"

#: Issue #5341 -- emitted when an operator's host-isolation declaration reaches
#: an adapter that owns a vendor sandbox. Records the declared tier, the
#: operator's evidence for it, the config layer the declaration came from, and
#: whether the adapter consequently dropped its vendor sandbox. Dropping a
#: sandbox is a posture change, so it belongs on the record as a statement
#: somebody made from a named source rather than as an unexplained flag flip:
#: a reader reconstructing a run can prove offline which declaration was in
#: force and what it was based on.
EVENT_HOST_ISOLATION_DECLARED = "sandbox.host_isolation_declared"

#: Issue #2663 -- emitted when capability-aware routing refuses a task because
#: no candidate adapter's declared profile satisfied its requirements. The event
#: anchors the content-addressed refusal receipt (its hash, the unmet axes, and
#: every candidate considered with the profile hash it presented) into the HMAC
#: chain, so a routing refusal is a signed, reconstructable record rather than a
#: silent fallback to a weaker adapter.
EVENT_ADAPTER_CAPABILITY_REFUSAL = "adapter.capability_refusal"

#: Issue #2367 -- emitted when the orchestrator forcibly reaps an agent
#: process tree.  The event records which platform mechanism delivered the
#: stop (POSIX process-group signalling or Windows process-tree
#: termination), whether the graceful stop was delivered, whether
#: escalation to a force-kill was required, and the grace window that

EVENT_PROCESS_REAP_RECEIPT = "process.reap_receipt"

#: Issue #3277 -- emitted whenever a supervisor detector decides an agent must
#: be force-killed. The event records WHY the decision was taken: the stall
#: reason, which detector fired, and the measured inputs (heartbeat age,
#: identical-snapshot count, the threshold crossed) that were in scope at the
#: moment the verdict was reached. It attests a verdict, never an outcome: the
#: worker may still be alive when this is written. The companion
#: ``process.reap_receipt`` event (joined on ``session_id``) attests that the
#: stop was actually delivered, so an operator reconstructing a failure window
#: can put "this detector saw these inputs and decided" next to "this mechanism
#: delivered the stop" without guessing.
EVENT_STALL_VERDICT = "stall.verdict"

#: Issue #2366 -- emitted whenever a scoped dashboard token is issued or
#: revoked. The event mirrors the signed registry row: the short token id,
#: the token digest, the principal, the scope, and the grant kind -- never
#: the raw token (the registry itself only ever stores the digest). Together
#: with the ``governance.decision`` events the dashboard authz layer
#: records, the chain carries the full life of a dashboard credential:
#: grant, every write it authorized, and revocation.
EVENT_DASHBOARD_TOKEN_GRANT = "dashboard.token_grant"

#: Issue #2365 -- emitted for every operator action on the run review board
#: (approve / request-changes / merge). The signed, principal-named receipt
#: binds the decision to the projection the operator saw (``projection_hash``)
#: and the exact journal head it chained onto (``journal_entry_hash``), so a
#: reviewer can prove from the chain alone that a named principal took the
#: action against that board state without operator override.
EVENT_REVIEW_BOARD_ACTION = "review_board.action"

#: Issue #2352 -- emitted at every lifecycle boundary of a detached run
#: (submit, detach, reattach, daemon restart, complete). The daemon that owns
#: the run is a projection of the durable work ledger; each receipt binds the
#: ledger head at the boundary so a reattaching operator can prove, from the
#: chain alone, that the current ledger is a forward extension of the head
#: they last saw -- nothing happened off the record while they were away.
#: Only the run id, the transition, the ledger head/entry count, and (for
#: reattach/restart boundaries) the ``from_head``/``to_head``/``entries_added``
#: continuity span are recorded -- never goal text or task payloads.
EVENT_RUN_LIFECYCLE = "run.lifecycle"

#: Issue #3469 -- the one authenticated terminal marker shared by every run
#: execution path.  The marker binds the outcome and exactly one authoritative
#: state anchor: the Merkle journal head for orchestrator runs, or the durable
#: work-ledger head for detached RunService runs.  It is a statement at one
#: HMAC-chain position, not a write barrier: a verifier must scan forward and
#: invalidate closure when a later event for the same run appears.
EVENT_RUN_CLOSURE = "run.closure"

#: Issue #2364 -- emitted whenever an MCP Tasks-extension run handle is minted
#: for a long-running run. The event carries the handle receipt: the task id,
#: the run id, the projected status, the run journal head, the embedded
#: audit-chain head, the receipt hash, the pinned spec revision, and the
#: ingested W3C trace id (empty when none). A client that polled the handle
#: can prove offline that the task it watched corresponds to the audited run
#: by recomputing the receipt hash from the journal and matching the embedded
#: chain head against this chain.
EVENT_MCP_TASK_HANDLE = "mcp.task_handle"

#: Issue #2363 -- emitted whenever a SPIRE-issued X.509-SVID is bound to an
#: agent card. The event pins the binding's content hash together with the
#: derived SPIFFE ID, the install fingerprint, the card hash, and the leaf
#: SVID's content address -- never the SVID private key. Because the binding's
#: identity is its content hash and that hash is chained here, the mapping
#: between platform identity (the SVID) and card identity is reconstructable
#: and tamper-evident offline: a verifier holding the chain and the install
#: public key can prove after the fact that a card was bound to exactly this
#: SVID and that neither has been altered since.
EVENT_SPIFFE_SVID_BINDING = "spiffe.svid_binding"

#: Issue #5030 -- emitted when a token bound to an X.509-SVID is presented by
#: something that could not prove it holds that SVID. The event pins the
#: content-addressed refusal receipt together with the code naming *which*
#: proof failed (no certificate presented, wrong thumbprint, expired leaf,
#: unparseable leaf, or an audience that requires a binding the token lacks),
#: the SPIFFE ID of the SVID that should have been used, and the expected and
#: presented thumbprints. A gateway that rejects a replayed token says the
#: request was denied; this says a token issued to one workload was presented
#: by something that could not prove it was that workload, at a named chain
#: position, and the statement verifies offline after the incident. Records
#: identifiers, thumbprints, and the verdict only -- never the token or the
#: certificate.
EVENT_TOKEN_BINDING_REFUSAL = "identity.token_binding_refusal"

#: Issue #2361 -- emitted when an operator approves (or rejects) the
#: requirement set drafted from a spec, before the deterministic compiler
#: turns it into a task graph. The event binds the content-addressed
#: requirement-set hash, the source-spec hash, the requirement count, the
#: compiled graph hash, and the decision into the HMAC chain. The receipt
#: is the plan-approval gate for the spec pipeline: a verifier can prove,
#: from the chain alone, that a given task graph was compiled from a
#: requirement set the operator signed off on -- no requirement line was
#: added or altered after approval without breaking the chain.
EVENT_SPEC_REQUIREMENT_SET = "spec.requirement_set"

#: Issue #2354 -- emitted once per cost-aware dispatch decision. The
#: deterministic decision (admit/halt under USD caps) is a pure function of a
#: hash-pinned price table, the spend ledger, and the caps; this event mirrors
#: the decision's identity into the HMAC chain by recording ``{decision_hash,
#: run_id, task_id, admit, breached_dimension, projected_overrun_usd,
#: price_table_hash, ledger_state_hash, policy_hash, journal_entry_hash}``. A
#: verifier holding the same ledger and price table recomputes the decision
#: byte-identically and checks it against the chain, so a halt names exactly
#: why it fired and two operators replay the same budget decision. Only hashes,
#: the verdict, and the projected overrun are recorded -- never prompt content.
EVENT_COST_DISPATCH_RECEIPT = "cost.dispatch_receipt"

#: Issue #2353 -- emitted whenever a tournament selects a winning attempt.
#: The event mirrors the signed selection receipt: the task id, the tournament
#: receipt hash (spine anchor), the winning attempt hash, the full set of
#: attempt hashes, and the evaluator names that decided the outcome -- never a
#: model judgement (there is none in the decision path). A verifier can join a
#: chain entry to the offline-verifiable receipt and prove which attempt won
#: and why, without re-running the tournament.
EVENT_TOURNAMENT_SELECTION = "tournament.selection"

#: Issue #2352 (AC4) -- emitted once per detached-run task executed on the ssh
#: sandbox backend. The receipt binds the run and task ids, the remote host, the
#: isolated remote worktree the task ran in, the task's exit code, a digest of
#: the per-task isolation marker written into that worktree, and the work-ledger
#: head at execution time. Only non-secret identifiers and hashes are recorded
#: -- never goal text, task payloads, or injected credentials -- so an auditor
#: can prove from the chain alone that each task of a goal ran in its own
#: worktree across the ssh boundary (distinct worktree per task, none lost).
EVENT_RUN_SSH_TASK = "run.ssh_task"

#: Issue #2556 -- emitted whenever a typed ``blocker`` bulletin signal is
#: materialized into a clearance gate, and again at each clearance / expiry
#: transition. Posting a ``blocker`` deterministically projects a clearance
#: task plus injected ``depends_on`` edges onto the open dependent tasks in the
#: blocker's scope; the whole chain (blocker signal -> clearance task + injected
#: edges -> resolution) is sealed as a receipt on the HMAC chain. The event
#: records ``{blocker_content_hash, clearance_task_id, injected_edges,
#: graph_delta_hash, scope_cell_id, deadline, last_state_hash,
#: journal_entry_hash, blocker_entry_hash, resolution (pending/cleared/expired),
#: resolver}``. ``graph_delta_hash`` is a pure function of the recorded detail
#: fields, so a verifier recomputes it byte-identically from the chain entry
#: alone; a resolution entry references the materialization entry hash via
#: ``blocker_entry_hash``. The signal-to-gate map is a pure projection, so two
#: operators replaying the same bulletin journal produce byte-identical gates --
#: strip the deterministic scheduler and this chain and the gate collapses to a
#: logged blocker. See :mod:`bernstein.core.communication.signal_actions`.
EVENT_SIGNAL_GATE_PROJECTION = "signal.gate_projection"

#: Issue #2515 -- emitted for every spawn-time adapter security-floor decision
#: (permit, refusal, or explicit warn-only override). The event binds the
#: probed adapter, the installed upstream version, the minimum-safe floor, the
#: advisory id, the enforcement policy, the floor map's content hash, and the
#: content hash of the sealed refusal receipt into the HMAC chain. Permits
#: carry the verdict too, so a contiguous chain slice proves offline that no
#: below-floor adapter spawn was permitted during a window -- and a mutated
#: floor map is caught because the receipt pins the map's content hash. Strip
#: the chain and the floor-map hash and a refusal degrades to a logged version
#: check; with them the refusal is the tamper-evident proof artefact.
EVENT_ADAPTER_SPAWN_PREFLIGHT = "adapter.spawn_preflight_receipt"

#: Issue #2515 -- emitted by ``bernstein doctor`` when it snapshots the
#: environment's adapter version posture. The event binds a content-addressed
#: posture receipt (each tracked adapter's installed version, floor, advisory
#: id, and floor verdict) and the floor map's content hash into the HMAC
#: chain, so "only floor-satisfying binaries were spawnable in this
#: environment during window X" is provable offline from a contiguous chain
#: slice rather than living only in a console print that an operator may never
#: run.
EVENT_ADAPTER_VERSION_POSTURE = "adapter.version_posture"

#: Issue #2515 -- emitted when the adapter security-floor map is refreshed from
#: a machine-readable advisory feed. The event binds the old and new floor-map
#: content hashes and the data-only diff into the HMAC chain, so a floor bump
#: is an attested event: a reviewer can prove offline which floor map was in
#: force when a spawn-preflight or version-posture receipt (which pin the same
#: content hash) was recorded, before and after the bump.
EVENT_ADAPTER_FLOOR_UPDATE = "adapter.floor_update_receipt"

#: Issue #2514 -- emitted at plan-approval time when the approved goal is
#: compiled into an intent capsule and written to the chain. The event binds
#: ``{task_id, plan_id, run_id, capsule_hash, goal_digest,
#: allowed_action_classes_hash, expiry_ts}`` so a verifier can prove, from the
#: chain alone, that a worker's run was governed by a capsule the operator
#: signed off on -- and that the on-disk capsule bytes still hash to the
#: chain-recorded ``capsule_hash`` (a tampered capsule diverges). Only hashes
#: and identifiers are recorded -- never the goal text (bound by digest).
EVENT_INTENT_CAPSULE = "intent.capsule"

#: Issue #2514 -- emitted when the deterministic drift monitor detects an action
#: class outside the approved capsule and emits a signed escalation receipt. The
#: event mirrors ``{task_id, capsule_hash, verdict_hash, divergent_count,
#: escalation_journal_entry_hash}`` into the chain so an operator can prove, from
#: the chain alone, that a drift escalation was emitted against a named capsule
#: with a given deterministic verdict. The divergent events themselves live in
#: the run journal and the signed escalation receipt; this event records only
#: their identity.
EVENT_INTENT_DRIFT = "intent.drift"

#: Issue #2649 -- emitted when a capsule-governed run's journal is sealed. The
#: event mirrors ``{task_id, run_id, capsule_hash, journal_head, event_count}``
#: into the chain so a verifier has an independent commitment to the journal's
#: END. Without it, any prefix of a valid journal is itself a valid journal:
#: the Merkle chain recomputes from genesis, so a worker can delete the trailing
#: rows that convict it and present a shorter, internally consistent history.
#: The seal is what makes truncation detectable -- a proof that reads only what
#: remains cannot tell what was removed.
EVENT_INTENT_JOURNAL_SEAL = "intent.journal_seal"

#: Issue #2520 -- emitted once per statistical eval gate verdict. The verdict
#: (significant_improvement / non_inferior / insufficient_evidence /
#: significant_regression) is a pure function of the paired 2x2 discordance
#: table, alpha, the non-inferiority margin, and the minimum n; this event
#: mirrors the sealed verdict receipt's identity into the HMAC chain by
#: recording ``{receipt_hash, verdict, suite_content_hash,
#: baseline_result_set_hash, candidate_result_set_hash, n_per_arm, effect,
#: interval_low, interval_high, alpha, min_n_satisfied, journal_entry_hash}``.
#: A verifier holding the same result sets recomputes the verdict and the
#: receipt hash byte-identically, so a promotion decision names exactly the
#: evidence it stood on. Only hashes, the verdict, and the rounded statistics
#: are recorded -- never task prompts or agent output.
EVENT_EVAL_GATE_VERDICT = "eval.gate_verdict"

#: Issue #3759 -- emitted once per sealed fan-out receipt
#: (``build_run_graph_receipt``). The event binds the receipt hash (the CAS
#: identity of the full receipt), the graph root hash, the per-node hashes,
#: and the spine journal entry hash so a verifier can prove, from the chain
#: alone, that the exact set of N branches came from one fan-out, anchored by
#: a single signed object. Only hashes and the anchor are recorded -- never
#: the raw worktree or spine content.
EVENT_RUN_GRAPH_SEALED = "run_graph.sealed"

#: Issue #2520 -- emitted when a significant_regression verdict at canary or
#: default rolls a candidate configuration back. The revocation receipt names
#: the content hashes of the verdict receipts it revokes and the stage the
#: deterministic promotion projection reverts to; this event mirrors that
#: linkage into the HMAC chain by recording ``{receipt_hash,
#: candidate_config_id, revoked_receipt_hashes, reverts_to_stage,
#: reverts_to_config_id, trigger_receipt_hash, journal_entry_hash}``. A
#: verifier folding the receipt chain offline reproduces the identical
#: rollback, so a regression postmortem links the exact receipt that admitted
#: the change to the receipt that revoked it.
EVENT_EVAL_GATE_REVOCATION = "eval.gate_revocation"

#: Issue #2925 -- emitted once per sealed benchmark-score trajectory receipt
#: (``bernstein benchmark receipt emit``). The event binds the receipt hash
#: (the CAS identity of the full receipt), the benchmark run id, the
#: suite-content hash (contamination anchor), the published score, the task
#: count, and the status (``ok`` or ``NO_TASKS``). A verifier holding the
#: receipt can recompute the suite-content hash from the embedded task ids and
#: re-derive the aggregate score from the per-task components, so neither the
#: suite composition nor the printed scalar is trusted -- both are proven from
#: the sealed trajectory.
EVENT_TRAJECTORY_RECEIPT = "eval.trajectory_receipt"

#: Issue #2513 -- emitted whenever an egress-relevant decision consults the
#: propagated taint of an artefact. Records ``{target, trust, tainted,
#: decision, closure_size, trust_records}`` so a verifier folding the chain
#: offline reconstructs exactly which artefact's provenance drove the egress
#: verdict and to which lineage records the taint traced.
EVENT_PROVENANCE_TAINT_DECISION = "provenance.taint_decision"

#: Issue #2513 -- emitted whenever an untrusted payload is passed through the
#: quarantined structural parser before anything from it reaches worker
#: context. Records ``{source_content_hash, extracted_fields,
#: withheld_fields}`` so the extraction edge (structured fields kept, free
#: text withheld) is itself anchored into the chain.
EVENT_PROVENANCE_QUARANTINE = "provenance.quarantine"

#: Issue #2544 -- admission events mirror the hash-chained admission ledger's
#: grants, waivers, quarantines, and tag-conformance seals into the HMAC chain.
#: Each event records only the admission row's identity (its ledger
#: ``entry_hash``) plus the resource and the projected head, never the payloads
#: themselves, so an operator can prove from the audit chain alone that a grant
#: was issued (and against which pool, and at which chain head) without carrying
#: the ledger. Two operators replaying the admission ledger derive the identical
#: grant order; these events anchor that order into the tamper-evident log.
EVENT_ADMISSION_GRANT = "admission.grant_receipt"
EVENT_ADMISSION_WAIVER = "admission.waiver_receipt"
EVENT_ADMISSION_QUARANTINE = "admission.quarantine_receipt"
EVENT_ADMISSION_TAG_CONFORMANCE = "admission.tag_conformance_receipt"
#: Issue #2511 -- emitted once per approval card v2 issuance. An approval card
#: is a hash-committed decision record: the operator-visible envelope (action
#: and canonical args digest, bounded reasoning digest, blast-radius impact
#: estimate, rollback procedure with an explicit irreversible marker, and a
#: ``not_after`` expiry) is canonicalised and hashed into ``card_hash``, and
#: this event stores the full envelope plus ``card_hash`` and
#: ``prev_chain_digest``. Because the whole envelope is inside the signed HMAC
#: chain, a verifier can reconstruct exactly the fields shown to the operator
#: and detect any post-hoc mutation: a mutated envelope no longer hashes to the
#: recorded ``card_hash`` and no longer matches the chain HMAC. Strip the chain
#: and the card degrades from a verifiable decision record to a message with a
#: log.
EVENT_APPROVAL_CARD_ISSUED = "chat.approval_card.issued"

#: Issue #2511 -- emitted when an issued approval card is resolved (approve /
#: reject) after the gate has confirmed the echoed ``card_hash`` matches the
#: issued envelope and the decision arrived before ``not_after``. The event
#: binds ``{card_hash, decision, approver, worktree_id, resolved_at}`` so a
#: verifier can join the decision to the exact issued envelope and prove the
#: operator decided against the fields that were hashed, not a divergent view.
EVENT_APPROVAL_CARD_RESOLVED = "chat.approval_card.resolved"

#: Issue #2511 -- emitted when the gate refuses to resolve an approval card:
#: either the echoed ``card_hash`` does not match any issued envelope (a field
#: the operator saw was mutated) or the decision arrived at or after
#: ``not_after`` (expiry is enforced by the chain-side clock regardless of what
#: the chat client still renders). The refusal records ``{card_hash, reason,
#: expected_card_hash, worktree_id}`` so an operator can prove, from the chain
#: alone, that a stale or tampered decision was contained and never executed.
EVENT_APPROVAL_CARD_REFUSED = "chat.approval_card.refused"

#: Issue #2545 -- emitted whenever an input boundary (schedule fire, recipe
#: launch, MCP ``bernstein_run`` / ``bernstein_scenario`` call, or task-server
#: claim) refuses a parameter that fails its declared contract. The event binds
#: the signed refusal receipt's identity into the HMAC chain: the offending
#: field's JSONPath, the declared schema hash, a digest of the rejected value
#: (raw bytes never stored), the boundary, and the content hash of the sealed
#: receipt. Rejection happens strictly before any adapter or model invocation,
#: so a contiguous chain slice proves offline that a malformed fire was refused
#: at zero spend -- and a mutated receipt is caught because the chain pins its
#: content hash. Strip the chain and the receipt degrades to a logged
#: validation error; with them the refusal is the tamper-evident proof artefact.
EVENT_INPUT_REFUSAL = "input.refusal_receipt"

#: Issue #2545 -- emitted once per spawned worker whose runtime context capsule
#: is sealed. The capsule is a content-addressed, Ed25519-signed record of what
#: the worker was given (task id, run id, params hash, worktree, role, budget
#: envelope remaining, dependency state, and the audit chain head at spawn, plus
#: the intent capsule hash when one exists). This event mirrors ``{task_id,
#: run_id, params_hash, capsule_hash, audit_chain_head, intent_capsule_hash}``
#: into the HMAC chain so a verifier holding only the journal and the chain can
#: recompute the capsule byte-identically at the recorded chain position; a
#: context divergence (different params, budget, or chain head than asserted) is
#: caught as a hash mismatch. Only hashes and identifiers are recorded -- never
#: prompt or budget content.
EVENT_CONTEXT_CAPSULE = "context.capsule"
#: Issue #2509 -- emitted once per mission phase advancement (pass or halt). A
#: mission is a ledger-projected multi-day goal; a phase advances only by a
#: mission phase receipt that binds the gate verdict, the evidence bundle
#: hashes it verified, the ledger position, the envelope, and the envelope
#: spend at gate time. This event mirrors ``{mission_id, phase_id, gate_passed,
#: receipt_hash, evidence_bundle_hashes, ledger_seq, envelope, spend_usd,
#: reason, journal_entry_hash}`` into the HMAC chain so a phase pass (or an
#: envelope-exhausted halt) is provable offline from the chain alone. The
#: receipt binding lives as a ``mission.phase_passed`` / ``mission.phase_halted``
#: entry in the work ledger; the projection derives phase state from receipts
#: and ledger entries only, so a phase without a receipt is by definition not
#: passed. Only identifiers, hashes, the verdict, and the spend are recorded --
#: never goal text or task payloads.
EVENT_MISSION_PHASE_RECEIPT = "mission.phase_receipt"

#: Issue #2510 -- emitted once per recurring mission digest fire. A mission
#: digest is a pure deterministic projection of the mission state at a fire
#: instant (see :mod:`bernstein.core.orchestration.mission_digest`); this event
#: anchors that projection in the HMAC chain by recording ``{mission_id,
#: fire_time, digest_hash, receipt_id, mission_status_hash, ledger_head,
#: phases_passed, gates_passed, gates_failed, total_spend_usd, schedule_id,
#: recurrence, fire_graph_hash, journal_entry_hash}`` plus the previous chain
#: digest. The posted chat message embeds ``digest_hash``, so a recipient
#: recomputes the digest from the ledger and proves the message matches the
#: chain-attested receipt; a tampered receipt fails chain verification at its
#: exact position. ``receipt_id`` is the per-fire delivery idempotency key, a
#: pure function of ``(mission_id, fire_time, digest_hash)``, so a restart
#: between fire computation and delivery does not double-post. Only identifiers,
#: hashes, counts, and the spend are recorded -- never goal text or task
#: payloads.
EVENT_MISSION_DIGEST_RECEIPT = "mission.digest_receipt"

#: Issue #2558 -- emitted once per receipt appended to a leaderless MESH claim
#: journal (see :class:`bernstein.core.orchestration.tracker_pipeline.ClaimJournal`).
#: A MESH claim journal is a signed, append-only, Merkle-chained log of every
#: self-claim, release, renewal, expiry, and supersession; the SQLite
#: ``ClaimLedger`` is a deterministic projection (fold) of it rather than the
#: source of truth. This event mirrors ``{kind, tracker, ticket_id, role,
#: claimer_id, node_id, lease_expires_at, prev_entry_hash, journal_entry_hash,
#: supersedes, winner_claimer_id, winner_entry_hash}`` into the HMAC chain so a
#: claim decision -- including a deterministic ``supersede`` naming the winner of
#: a concurrent double-claim -- is provable offline from the chain alone. The
#: receipt binding lives in the journal; the projection derives claim state from
#: receipts only, so a claim without a receipt is by definition not held. Only
#: identifiers and hashes are recorded -- never ticket or workspace contents.
EVENT_CLAIM_JOURNAL_RECEIPT = "cluster.claim_journal_receipt"

#: Issue #2549 -- emitted whenever a per-goal SLA contract is evaluated against
#: chain evidence inside a supervisor tick and found breached. A breach is a
#: signed, offline-verifiable violation receipt (see
#: :mod:`bernstein.core.orchestration.sla_receipt`); this event mirrors the
#: receipt's identity into the HMAC chain by recording ``{contract_id,
#: contract_hash, subject_type, subject_id, tick_instant, breached_axes,
#: requested_action, effective_action, remediation_blocked, receipt_digest}``
#: plus the previous chain digest. Because the receipt embeds the evidence and
#: re-derives its verdict and remediation offline, a verifier holding only the
#: receipt confirms the breach without orchestrator state; this event lets an
#: operator prove, from the audit chain alone, that the breach was detected at a
#: named chain position with a given remediation. Only identifiers, hashes, the
#: breached axes, and the remediation decision are recorded -- never goal text
#: or artifact contents. Evaluation is read-only and never dispatches a task.
EVENT_SLA_VIOLATION = "sla.violation"

#: Durable task suspension receipts (#2552). A park is made durable by two
#: chained receipts plus their journal rows: ``task.suspend_receipt`` binds the
#: suspend journal row's Merkle head (the suspension's identity), the parked
#: workspace hash, and the envelope balance at park time *before any effect
#: runs*; ``task.resume_receipt`` binds the suspend receipt it continued from,
#: the effective continuation mode, and the new workspace hash. The receipt
#: pair is the continuity proof: a verifier holding a copied chain confirms the
#: resumed run continued from exactly the parked workspace hash, or reads the
#: recorded fork/cold downgrade with its reason. Only identifiers, hashes,
#: modes, and spend are recorded -- never prompt content or session state.
EVENT_TASK_SUSPENDED = "task.suspend_receipt"
EVENT_TASK_RESUMED = "task.resume_receipt"

#: Infrastructure-release receipt for a durable suspension (#2552). Every seat
#: return, sandbox teardown, process reap, and envelope-headroom release hangs
#: off the suspend receipt hash: the release row records which resource was

#: there is no suspension, only a dead process.
EVENT_TASK_RESOURCE_RELEASE = "task.suspend_resource_release"

#: receipt projects an existing audit-chain range into standard, offline-
#: verifiable envelopes (COSE_Sign1, in-toto/DSSE, RFC 6962 transparency).
#: The event mirrors the projection's identity into the HMAC chain by recording
#: ``{head_sha256, since, until, event_count, receipt_sha256, formats}`` plus
#: the previous chain digest, so the fact that a standard receipt was emitted
#: over a named range (and which head it bound) is itself chain-attested. The

    """Fold claim and release receipts into the last claimant per task (#3037).

    Offline reconstruction from the chain alone: a ``task.claim_receipt``
    records a task as taken by its claimer, the matching
    ``task.release_receipt`` drops it. Pass a prefix of the chain to
    reconstruct the same projection as of that point.

    This is not "who is executing this task right now". Delivery mints no
    release receipt, so a task that ran to completion stays mapped to the
    worker that delivered it until something puts it back in the pool. What
    the fold does guarantee is the property the acquisition-only ledger could
    not support: every path that returns a task to the pool records a release
    first, so a task is never mapped to one claimant while another holds it.
    Cross-check the task's status when the caller needs liveness rather than
    attribution.

    A release for a task with no recorded claim is tolerated (the claim may
    predate the range passed in, or have been granted through a store-level
    path that mints no receipt) and simply leaves the task unclaimed.

    Two regions of a chain answer this question dishonestly unless bounded:

    * Chains written before #3037 carry acquisitions only, so over that
      region the fold reports every task ever claimed as still claimed.
      :func:`release_ledger_boundary` locates the first release receipt so a
      verifier can answer "unknown" over the earlier region instead of
      answering confidently and wrongly.
    * Claims minted through a path in :data:`UNRELEASED_CLAIM_PATHS` (#3072)
      never receive a release receipt at all, at any chain age. Scope the
      fold with ``claim_paths`` to exclude them from a hold ledger, or to
      select exactly them when auditing the MCP acquisition log.

    Args:
        events: Audit events in chain order. Non-claim events are ignored, so
            the full chain can be passed unfiltered.
        claim_paths: When given, only claim receipts whose recorded
            ``claim_path`` is in this set enter the fold. Release receipts
            are not path-scoped: a release always drops the task it names,
            so a filtered-in claim is dropped by its release exactly as in
            the unfiltered fold. ``None`` (the default) folds every claim,
            preserving the historical answer.

    Returns:
        Mapping of task id to the identifier that last claimed it without a
        recorded release. Tasks whose claim was released are absent. A claim

# lifecycle lives on this chain: register, supersede (definition change),
# rollback (re-point the name at a prior hash), pause / resume (a
# definition-level fire gate), a collision receipt for every overlap the
# supervisor evaluates, and a fleet apply bound to a reviewed plan hash.
# There is no mutable registry row; the live name -> hash mapping is a pure
# projection of these receipts. The constants are additive; never edit or
# remove an existing entry.

#: A recipe definition was registered for the first time under a name.
EVENT_RECIPE_REGISTER = "recipe.register"

#: A changed definition body supersedes the prior hash for a name
#: (operator-signed: carries old_hash and new_hash and a spine edge).

#: A name was re-pointed at a prior definition hash (rollback receipt);
#: nothing is deleted, the roll-back is itself a chain record.

#: fires while keeping the recipe's identity and history.
EVENT_RECIPE_PAUSE = "recipe.pause"

#: A paused recipe was resumed.
EVENT_RECIPE_RESUME = "recipe.resume"

#: The supervisor evaluated a concurrency collision against a still-running
#: fire and emitted a deterministic decision (ENQUEUE / CANCEL_NEW /
#: SUPERSEDE_WITH_HANDOFF). Emitted for every evaluated collision so a
#: double-fire is a recorded decision rather than a silent double-write.

#: the apply receipt binds the reviewed plan to the registry mutation.
EVENT_RECIPE_FLEET_APPLY = "recipe.fleet_apply"

#: of the contended predecessor the projection must follow. Nothing is

#: fork produced by a concurrent write, which fails closed everywhere else.
EVENT_RECIPE_LINEAGE_RESOLVE = "recipe.lineage_resolve"

#: A registered recipe actually submitted work. Written only after the task
#: graph was handed to the dispatcher and the dispatcher returned identifiers

#: with the install's Ed25519 sovereign identity, and mirrored here by
#: recording ``{signed_body, signature, signer_public_key_pem}`` -- never the

#
# Three named-configuration primitives share one discipline: every write,
# rotation, and activation is a chain event, so config identity is a pure
# projection of these receipts rather than a mutable live-state row. A
# variable write records the old and new value hashes plus the per-name
# write ordinal; a connection-document lifecycle records create / rotate /
# resolve / refuse against the document's content hash; a context activation
# records the canonical effective-settings hash. The constants are additive;
# never edit or remove an existing entry.

#: A fleet variable was written: carries the variable name, the prior value
#: hash, the new value hash, and the per-name write ordinal (chain_position).
#: A live-value config store cannot replay through mutation; because the
#: write hashes are chained, a later mutation cannot rewrite what a pinned
#: read resolved.

# A pool's lifecycle lives in the chain: register/update/retire events are the
# only mutation path, and the runtime pool registry is a deterministic
# projection rebuilt by replaying them (see
# ``bernstein.core.sandbox.pool_registry``). Placement is a receipt: every
# dispatch seals ``(pool_hash, effective_manifest_hash, chosen_backend)`` so a
# run's placement is provable offline from the chain alone, and a refused
# override is itself chained so an over-broad recipe leaves a tamper-evident
# trace instead of merely being absent from logs.

#: A pool manifest was registered. Records the pool name and its canonical
#: ``pool_hash`` so the registry projection can be rebuilt from the chain.
EVENT_POOL_REGISTERED = "pool.registered"

#: A pool manifest was updated (superseded by a new canonical hash). Records
#: both the prior and the new ``pool_hash`` so the projection is unambiguous.
EVENT_POOL_UPDATED = "pool.updated"

#: A pool was retired. The projection drops it; existing receipts still verify.
EVENT_POOL_RETIRED = "pool.retired"

#: A governed override was refused by the pool ceiling before any sandbox was
#: created. Records the pool, the offending field, and the machine-readable
#: refusal reason so the fail-closed decision is chain-attested, not just a log.
EVENT_POOL_OVERRIDE_REFUSED = "pool.override_refused"

#: A dispatch sealed its placement into the chain. Records the pool, template,
#: overrides, and effective manifest hashes plus the chosen backend, so the
#: placement of any run is provable offline (AC: verifiability).
EVENT_POOL_PLACEMENT_RECEIPT = "pool.placement_receipt"

#: A worker enrolled into a pool. Records the ``pool_hash``, the worker's
#: install-identity key id, and the enrolment signature so the execution host
#: of subsequent claims is cryptographically attributable (AC: verifiability).
EVENT_POOL_WORKER_ENROLLED = "pool.worker_enrolled"

#: A pool-scoped claim was signed by an enrolled worker. Records the claim
#: hash, the worker key id, the signature, and the placement receipt hash so a
#: reviewer can prove which enrolled host executed the run.
EVENT_POOL_CLAIM_RECEIPT = "pool.claim_receipt"

#: A warm pre-provisioned slot was quarantined because its provisioned manifest
#: hash diverged from the dispatch's effective hash. Records both hashes so the
#: infra drift is chain-attested and the dispatch falls back to cold cleanly.
EVENT_POOL_WARM_QUARANTINE = "pool.warm_quarantine"

#: Issue #2611 -- emitted once per attenuated delegation capability-token mint
#: (see :mod:`bernstein.core.security.capability_tokens`). The event mirrors the
#: token's ``{token_hash, issuer_identity_id, subject_identity_id,
#: parent_token_hash, remaining_depth}`` into the HMAC chain and embeds the prior
#: chain digest, so the token's ``audit_head`` (the tip captured at mint) and the
#: event's ``prev_chain_digest`` cross-reference each other. A verifier can prove,
#: from the chain alone, that a specific authority token was minted at a specific
#: point in history without the record exposing the token's caveats or signature.
