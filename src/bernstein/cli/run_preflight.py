    The non-interactive detach path (issue #3528, #4246) briefly confirms the

    died before the goal was ever decomposed -- the reproduced shape where a
    run leaves its one root task stuck ``claimed``/``in_progress``/``orphaned``
    forever with no live agent and no plan. The TTY dashboard, the Rich
    fallback, and ``--quiet`` all reproduce the same silence: none of them
    checks for this shape, so they detach (or keep waiting) exactly as if the
    run were healthy.

    Called at the start of each of those three branches, before the branch's
    own longer-running work begins, so the check lands close to the failure
    window described in the reproduction (the agent dies almost immediately
    after spawn) rather than after a dashboard session or a multi-hour quiet
    wait have already moved past it.

    Raises the same ``BernsteinFirstRunError``/``NO_PLAN_PRODUCED`` pair the
    non-interactive branch raises, so this is the single producer of the
    diagnosis text across every surface -- no renderer composes its own
    message. A spawn refusal is left untouched here; each branch's existing
    terminal-state check already accounts for it once the refused task
    reaches a terminal status.

    """Render either the interactive dashboard or the final summary.

    Uses terminal capability detection (TUI-003) to choose between the
    full Textual TUI and a Rich-based fallback for unsupported terminals.

    Cleanup ordering (gh-953): the ``claimed/`` drain is wrapped in a
    ``try/finally`` around the renderer so that a UI crash (e.g. a shape
    mismatch in the run-summary payload) cannot leave completed tickets
    pinned in ``.sdd/backlog/claimed/`` indefinitely.  ``try/finally`` was
    chosen over reordering because (a) it preserves the existing render-then-
    cleanup ordering on the happy path so the summary still reflects the
    pre-drain state, and (b) it keeps cleanup correct even when the renderer
    raises ``SystemExit`` or ``KeyboardInterrupt``.

    Exit-code mapping applies on EVERY branch, not only ``--quiet``. Nothing
    turns ``--quiet`` on automatically and no documented workflow passes it, so
    binding the outcome signal to that one flag left the ordinary invocations
    -- the dashboard, the Rich fallback, and the non-interactive detach --
    exiting 0 on a run that did not meet its goal (issue #3010, whose own
    reproduction went down the non-interactive branch).

    What each branch can honestly report differs, because they observe
    different things:

    * ``--quiet`` waits for a terminal state, so it reports both of them:
      quiescence, and an orchestrator confirmed gone with work outstanding.
    * The other three do not wait. They check ONCE, after their own work is
      done, and report only an already-quiescent run. The "orchestrator gone"
      verdict is an inference from absence that needs a confirmation window
      across several observations (see ``_wait_for_run_completion``), which a
      single poll cannot supply.

    The non-interactive branch in particular detaches by design after roughly
    one spawner tick, so its check usually finds the run still in flight and
    changes nothing. It fires when a run reached a terminal state inside that
    window, which is the fast-failure case.

    A spawned-then-dead agent that never produced a plan (issue #3528) is
    diagnosed the same way on every branch via ``_raise_if_no_plan_after_spawn``,
    called before each branch's own wait so the check lands near the failure
    window instead of after it.

    Args:
        quiet: When True, wait for quiescence and print only the terminal summary.
        wait: Seconds to wait for quiescence, keeping the progress output;
