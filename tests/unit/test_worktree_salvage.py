"""Tests for worktree cleanup salvage (audit-088).

These tests use a real git repo + real ``git worktree add`` because the salvage
codepath shells out to ``git`` for status, add, commit, branch -M, and diff -
mocking all of that would defeat the purpose.  Each test runs in ``tmp_path``
so no state escapes the sandbox.
