# Feature Matrix

The exhaustive capability index the README links to as its full feature
matrix. Every row is verified against `src/bernstein/` on the current `main`.

The "Docs status" column reflects whether a page-level reference exists
(`Full`) or whether the capability is documented in source / module
docstrings only (`Brief`). `Full` rows link to their reference page.

Rows still marked `Brief` are deliberate: the capability is reachable from
the surface named in its Notes column, but is documented in source and
module docstrings rather than on its own reference page. Every row names a
surface an operator can invoke. `tests/unit/test_cli_server_route_parity.py`
additionally holds the CLI's server calls to the registered route table.

The "Maturity" column says how far a capability has been proven, which is a
different question from whether a page documents it:

| Maturity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 5 | End-to-end evidence, no open correctness issues, docs current |
| 4 | Tested and documented, minor gaps |
| 3 | Works, known gaps |
| 2 | A first-run path is broken |
| 1 | Stub |

The score describes the subsystem behind the row, so rows served by the same
code usually carry the same number. `bernstein audit` and the audit-chain
capability rows move together; so do a CLI verb and the capability it drives.

`tests/unit/test_feature_matrix_drift.py` holds the CLI-commands section to
the commands the code registers: a new command with no row here fails that
test, and a row naming a command the CLI no longer registers fails it too.

## CLI commands

| Command | Docs status | Maturity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bernstein -g GOAL` | Full | 3 | Inline goal |
| `bernstein run plan.yaml` | Full | 3 | Plan file execution |
| `bernstein gc cas` | Full | 3 | Mark and sweep unreferenced blobs from the CAS store |
| `bernstein init` | Full | 3 | Workspace setup. The documented first run is covered by `tests/integration/test_first_run_documented_path.py`, which runs the command from an empty directory and asserts the created artifacts plus the key output lines documented in `first-run.md`. |
| `bernstein stop` | Full | 3 | Graceful/force stop |
| `bernstein live` | Full | 3 | TUI dashboard. Readiness is the first rendered frame, identified by the `AGENTS` and `TASKS` pane headers; `tests/integration/test_first_run_long_running_surfaces.py` starts it from an empty workspace, waits for that frame, and asserts a traceback-free exit on `SIGINT`. |
| `bernstein dashboard` | Full | 3 | Web dashboard |
| `bernstein status` | Full | 3 | Task summary |
| `bernstein ps` | Full | 3 | Process list |
| `bernstein cost` | Full | 4 | Spend breakdown |
| `bernstein doctor` | Full | 4 | Pre-flight health check |
| `bernstein recap` | Full | 3 | Post-run summary |
| `bernstein retro` | Full | 3 | Retrospective report |
| `bernstein runs report` | Full | 3 | Finished runs projected from the work ledger and classified `pr-opened` / `gate-failed` / `no-changes` / `infra-error` / `wedged`, each with the evidence line it was read from |
| `bernstein report commits/incident/postmortem` | Brief | 3 | Per-run markdown summaries: `commits` is per-agent commit attribution ([reference](../operations/commit-attribution.md)); `incident` correlates a timeline from logs, metrics, and traces; `postmortem` writes a structured report for a failed run. The group has no reference page of its own; `cli-reference.md` and `bernstein report --help` carry it |
| `bernstein trace ID` | Full | 3 | Decision trace |
| `bernstein logs` | Full | 3 | Agent log tail |
| `bernstein diff ID` | Full | 3 | Per-task git diff |
| `bernstein plan` | Full | 3 | Task backlog |
| `bernstein plan compile` | Full | 3 | Compile a spec into a gated task graph offline |
| [`bernstein replay ID`](../operations/replay.md) | Full | 3 | Deterministic replay |
| [`bernstein checkpoint`](../operations/checkpoint.md) | Full | 3 | Session snapshot |
| [`bernstein wrap-up`](../operations/wrap-up.md) | Full | 3 | End session with summary |
| `bernstein demo` | Full | 2 | **Preview.** Zero-config demo. A cold first run exits 1 with `Task server on port 8055 did not respond within 10.0s` and an empty `server.log`: a first-ever import of the package can exceed the server-readiness budget while Python byte-compiles it. The real budget is 30s (`_SERVER_READY_TIMEOUT_S`); the `10.0s` in the message is a stale hardcoded string — #3905. A second run on a warm cache starts the server in under a second. On a Windows console using a legacy code page the command also aborts with `UnicodeEncodeError` on the `✓` it prints first. |
| [`bernstein demo --flask-todo`](../getting-started/quickstart-demo.md) | Full | 2 | **Preview.** Flask TODO demo (3 tasks). `bernstein quickstart` is a deprecated alias, removed in v4.0.0. The run does not complete a first run: all three seeded tasks fail and the task server can die and restart mid-run. The reporting is no longer part of it — the summary counts against the seeded total and the command exits non-zero (#3902). |
| `bernstein agents ...` | Full | 3 | Catalog management |
| `bernstein evolve ...` | Full | 2 | **Preview.** A clean directory exits before the evolution loop starts because `.sdd/` is missing; initialise a Bernstein workspace first. |
| `bernstein ci fix` | Full | 3 | CI autofix |
| `bernstein github setup` | Full | 3 | GitHub App setup |
| [`bernstein worker`](../operations/cluster-mode.md) | Full | 3 | Join cluster as worker. Readiness is the `Registered as node <id>` line; `tests/integration/test_first_run_long_running_surfaces.py` registers one against a live cluster-enabled server and separately asserts the non-git-workspace refusal names its reason. |
