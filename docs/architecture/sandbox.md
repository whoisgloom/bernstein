# Sandbox backends

Bernstein isolates every spawned agent in a sandbox so multiple agents
running against the same repository cannot stomp on each other's
files, processes, or secrets. Historically the only sandbox type was
a local git worktree. The choice of sandbox is now pluggable - agents
can run inside worktrees, Docker containers, E2B microVMs, Modal
sandboxes, or any backend a plugin author registers.

This document covers:

- The `SandboxBackend` / `SandboxSession` protocol and the
  `WorkspaceManifest` / `SandboxCapability` value objects
- The nine first-party backends (`worktree`, `docker`, `e2b`, `modal`, `daytona`, `blaxel`, `runloop`, `vercel`, `microvm`)
- The `bernstein.sandbox_backends` entry-point group for third-party
  backends

## Protocol shape

The protocol lives in `src/bernstein/core/sandbox/`:

```python
from bernstein.core.sandbox import (
    SandboxBackend,
    SandboxSession,
    SandboxCapability,
    WorkspaceManifest,
    GitRepoEntry,
    FileEntry,
    ExecResult,
    get_backend,
    list_backends,
    register_backend,
)
```

### `SandboxBackend`

A `runtime_checkable` `Protocol`. Every backend exposes:

- `name: str` - canonical identifier referenced from `plan.yaml`.
- `capabilities: frozenset[SandboxCapability]` - feature flags.
- `async def create(manifest, options=None) -> SandboxSession` -
  provision a fresh sandbox.
- `async def resume(snapshot_id) -> SandboxSession` - restore a
  snapshot; raises `NotImplementedError` if the backend does not
  declare `SandboxCapability.SNAPSHOT`.
- `async def destroy(session) -> None` - tear down a session.

### `SandboxSession`

An `ABC` with six abstract methods:

- `read(path) -> bytes`
- `write(path, data, *, mode=0o644) -> None`
- `exec(cmd, *, cwd=None, env=None, timeout=None, stdin=None) -> ExecResult`
- `ls(path) -> list[str]`
- `snapshot() -> str` (SNAPSHOT-capable backends only)
- `shutdown() -> None` (idempotent)

`ExecResult` is a frozen dataclass with `exit_code`, `stdout`,
`stderr`, and `duration_seconds`.

### `SandboxCapability`

An `StrEnum` with six values: `FILE_RW`, `EXEC`, `NETWORK`, `GPU`,
`SNAPSHOT`, `PERSISTENT_VOLUMES`. Every backend advertises the set
it supports; schedulers reject manifests requiring capabilities the
selected backend does not expose.

### `WorkspaceManifest`

Immutable value object passed to `SandboxBackend.create`:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class WorkspaceManifest:
    root: str = "/workspace"
    repo: GitRepoEntry | None = None
    files: tuple[FileEntry, ...] = ()
    env: Mapping[str, str] = field(default_factory=dict)
    timeout_seconds: int = 1800
```

`GitRepoEntry` and `FileEntry` are companion frozen dataclasses.
Cloud-specific mount entries (S3, persistent volumes, secrets
manager bindings) are intentionally deferred to the storage-sinks
work.

## First-party backends

| Backend | Ships in | `capabilities`                                  | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `worktree` | core     | `FILE_RW`, `EXEC`, `NETWORK`                     | Wraps the existing `WorktreeManager`. Zero behaviour change. Default. |
| `docker`   | core     | `FILE_RW`, `EXEC`, `NETWORK`                     | Launches a container per session via the `docker` Python SDK. Needs `pip install bernstein[docker]`. |
| `e2b`      | `[e2b]` extra | `FILE_RW`, `EXEC`, `NETWORK`, `SNAPSHOT`     | Runs in E2B Firecracker microVMs. Needs `pip install bernstein[e2b]` plus `E2B_API_KEY`. |
| `modal`    | `[modal]` extra | `FILE_RW`, `EXEC`, `NETWORK`, `SNAPSHOT`, `GPU` | Serverless containers with optional GPU. Needs `pip install bernstein[modal]` plus `MODAL_TOKEN_ID` / `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`. |
| `microvm`  | core     | `FILE_RW`, `EXEC`, `NETWORK`, `SNAPSHOT`         | microVM per session — isolates kernel / network / PID namespace at a hardware boundary. Snapshots are **content-addressed** (the snapshot id *is* the SHA-256 of the image bytes in CAS). Two adapters: **libkrun** boots a real guest on Linux/KVM and macOS/arm64 (opt in with `BERNSTEIN_MICROVM_MONITOR=libkrun`; see [MicroVM on libkrun](../operations/microvm-libkrun.md)), **Firecracker** is the default and still refuses to boot. Opt-in: not a free backend, so the heuristic path never auto-selects it; an explicit `sandbox.backend: microvm` on an unsupported host fails loudly rather than degrading isolation. |

### Trade-offs

- **Latency.** `worktree` has no provisioning cost; `docker` adds a
  one-time pull plus ≤ 2 s container start; `e2b` / `modal` add 1–3 s
  of cold start per session plus provider-side overhead.
- **Cost.** `worktree` and `docker` are free (local compute). `e2b`
  bills by sandbox minute. `modal` bills by compute seconds, with
  optional GPU surcharges.
- **Isolation.** `worktree` shares the host filesystem and network;
  `docker` provides cgroup + namespace isolation but shares the
  kernel; `e2b` runs in a fresh Firecracker microVM per session;
  `modal` runs in dedicated serverless containers.
- **Capabilities.** `e2b`, `modal`, `daytona`, `runloop`, `vercel`, and `microvm` support snapshot/resume (as does the local `worktree`);
  only `modal` exposes GPU today.
- **Supported exec semantics.** Every first-party backend handles
  argv-based exec with exit-code, stdout, and stderr capture.

### Declared host isolation

The backends above are isolation Bernstein *provides*. Some CLI agents also
ship a sandbox of their own — codex spawns under `--sandbox workspace-write`,
implemented with bubblewrap — and that sandbox needs an unprivileged user
namespace to start. An operator running the CLI inside a container or VM they
control has usually removed exactly that (`--cap-drop ALL`,
`no-new-privileges`, unprivileged user namespaces disabled), so the agent's
sandbox cannot initialise and every command it issues is refused while the run
still exits 0.

The operator declares the isolation the host already applies, once, in the
normal config chain:

| Key | Env var | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `host_isolation_tier` | `BERNSTEIN_HOST_ISOLATION_TIER` | `none` |
| `host_isolation_evidence` | `BERNSTEIN_HOST_ISOLATION_EVIDENCE` | empty |

The tier vocabulary is `SandboxTier` (`none` < `process` < `container` <
`vm`), so it cannot drift from the tiers the rest of this layer ranks against;
anything outside it is rejected rather than assumed. `container` and `vm`
replace what the agent's own sandbox would have supplied, so an adapter that
advertises `consumes_host_isolation` drops it. `process` and `none` do not, so
it stays.

The declaration is anchored in the HMAC audit chain as a
`sandbox.host_isolation_declared` event carrying the tier, the operator's
evidence for it, the config layer it resolved from, and whether the agent's
sandbox was consequently dropped. Dropping a sandbox is a posture change, and
the record is what makes it a statement somebody made from a named source
rather than an unexplained flag flip.

- Injection seam: `AgentSpawner._get_adapter_by_name`
- Consumer today: `src/bernstein/adapters/codex.py`

## MicroVM backend and deterministic fork-and-race

The `microvm` backend (`src/bernstein/core/sandbox/backends/microvm.py`)
adds two things the rest of the sandbox layer was missing: a real
kernel/network/PID boundary, and a snapshot contract strong enough to
build reproducible, auditable races on.

> **Status: the deterministic core (snapshot / fork-race / signed receipt)
> is complete and fully tested. Two hypervisor adapters ship behind the same
> shim: `LibkrunMonitor`, which boots a real guest on ordinary developer
> hardware, and `FirecrackerMonitor`, whose boot lifecycle is still
> unimplemented.** `FirecrackerMonitor` ships the host preflight and the
> strict no-silent-downgrade contract. Its full boot lifecycle (API socket,
> drives, networking, `InstanceStart`, and an in-guest vsock agent for exec

> `boot()` therefore raises `MicroVMUnavailableError` on every host today
> rather than pretending. The guarantees below are exercised
> host-independently over the `FakeMonitor`.

**Monitor shim.** The backend never talks to a hypervisor directly. It
drives a `VMMonitor` adapter:

| Monitor | Module | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `LibkrunMonitor` | `backends/_libkrun.py` | Boots a real guest through libkrun (KVM on Linux, Hypervisor.framework on macOS/arm64). Opt-in via `BERNSTEIN_MICROVM_MONITOR=libkrun`. |
| `FirecrackerMonitor` | `backends/_vmmonitor.py` | Host preflight + no-silent-downgrade contract; boot lifecycle not implemented. Default. |
| `FakeMonitor` | `backends/_vmmonitor.py` | Deterministic, host-portable stand-in for the tests. Really executes commands and really freezes the workspace — not canned bytes. |

A Cloud Hypervisor variant fits behind the same shim and is deferred.

### The libkrun monitor

libkrun *is* the L1 hypervisor, so it needs no nested virtualisation and runs
on ordinary developer hardware — including Apple Silicon, where nested virt
would otherwise rule the boundary out entirely.

The decisive API is `krun_add_virtiofs()`. The session workspace is a host
directory passed straight through to the guest, so `read_file`, `write_file`,
`ls`, `freeze_image` and `restore_image` are plain host filesystem operations:
five of the protocol's nine members need **no guest agent at all**.
`freeze_image()` reuses `canonical_workspace_image` unchanged, so its digests
are byte-identical to the ones `FakeMonitor` produces for the same tree — there
is no second implementation to drift.

The shares are attached with `KRUN_SEMANTICS_LINUX_SIMPLIFIED`, which stores
permission bits in the host inode rather than an extended attribute. Guest and
host must agree on a file's mode, because the snapshot is taken by reading the
tree from the host: under the default semantics a file the guest creates `0644`
lands on the host `0600`, and freezing it would silently drop the executable bit
off anything the guest built.

`krun_start_enter()` never returns: the VMM takes over the calling process and
exits with the workload's exit code. One process therefore runs one VM, and
`exec()` spawns the `krunlaunch` binary per call (see
[host requirements](#host-requirements) for why that binary is separate). A
short-lived VM per `exec` is semantically correct here because all session state
lives in the shared workspace rather than in VM memory.

**Exit-code disambiguation.** libkrun reserves `125` (init could not set up the
environment), `126` (could not execute the workload) and `127` (workload not
found) for its own failures — and a guest command can legitimately return those
same values. The process exit code alone is therefore ambiguous. The guest
wrapper writes an explicit status line into a control directory that is *not*
part of the workspace, only after the command has finished. That file — not
the process exit code — decides:

| Status file | Process exit | Reported as |
|---|---|---|
| present, well-formed | anything | the guest command's exit code (including 125/126/127) |
| absent, or truncated/malformed | 125/126/127 | `MicroVMUnavailableError`, naming the libkrun-level reason |
| absent, or truncated/malformed | anything else | `MicroVMUnavailableError` — the result is unknown, never guessed |

The control directory lives outside the workspace precisely so stdio and the
status file can never reach a snapshot and shift its content address.

**No memory snapshots.** libkrun has no checkpoint/restore API (only
macOS-only `krun_vm_pause`/`krun_vm_resume`), which costs this backend nothing:
the snapshot contract is filesystem-level by design. That is also the safer
choice — restoring one VM memory snapshot into several VMs would replicate PRNG
state and cached secrets across the branches of a race.

#### Host requirements

Step-by-step setup, including troubleshooting, is in
[`docs/operations/microvm-libkrun.md`](../operations/microvm-libkrun.md).

Common to both platforms:

| Requirement | How it is configured |
|---|---|
| libkrun + libkrunfw (the guest kernel) installed | discovered in well-known locations; `$BERNSTEIN_MICROVM_LIBKRUN_LIB` overrides |
| The `krunlaunch` launcher binary, built once per host | `bernstein sandbox microvm-launcher`; `$BERNSTEIN_MICROVM_LIBKRUN_LAUNCHER` overrides the location |
| A guest root filesystem **directory** providing `/bin/sh` and a `mount` that speaks virtiofs | `$BERNSTEIN_MICROVM_LIBKRUN_ROOTFS` |
| Guest sizing (optional) | `$BERNSTEIN_MICROVM_LIBKRUN_VCPUS`, `$BERNSTEIN_MICROVM_LIBKRUN_RAM_MIB`, `$BERNSTEIN_MICROVM_LIBKRUN_SHM_BYTES` |

**Linux:** `/dev/kvm` must exist and be readable+writable by the running user.
Distribution packages provide `libkrun` and `libkrunfw`. A C compiler is needed
once, to build the launcher.

**macOS / Apple Silicon (arm64):** `brew tap slp/krun && brew install libkrun`
installs libkrun and libkrunfw. Hypervisor.framework additionally requires the
**running executable image** to be code-signed with the
`com.apple.security.hypervisor` entitlement — without it `krun_start_enter()`
returns `-EINVAL` and libkrun logs `Building the microVM failed:
Internal(Vm(VmSetup(VmCreate)))`.

This is the second reason the launcher is a separate binary. The entitlement
attaches to the image the kernel actually executes, and a framework CPython
(Homebrew, python.org) re-execs itself into
`Python.framework/.../Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python` — so
`sys.executable` is not that image, and signing it changes nothing. Rather than
asking operators to sign an interpreter, `bernstein sandbox microvm-launcher`
builds and ad-hoc-signs a launcher the project owns, with
`com.apple.security.hypervisor` and
`com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` (libkrun `dlopen`s libkrunfw,
which library validation would otherwise refuse). `preflight()` verifies both
entitlements are present on the binary it is about to spawn.

Intel Macs are not supported: libkrun's macOS backend is Apple-Silicon only.

`preflight()` names every one of these that is missing, side-effect-free — it
never builds the launcher as a side effect of a support probe — and `boot()`
refuses when any is missing. It never falls back to a weaker isolation mode.

#### What the boundary does and does not cover

**Does:** a separate guest kernel, a separate process tree, and a separate
network stack. Guest code cannot see host processes or the host filesystem
beyond what was shared.

**Does not:** the guest and the VMM share a security context — virtiofs is a
passthrough, not a sandbox, and it does not constrain access *within* the
directory that was shared beyond ordinary filesystem permissions. A guest that
escapes into the VMM process holds whatever privileges that process holds.
Confining the VMM itself (user namespaces, seccomp, or a dedicated uid on
Linux) remains the operator's responsibility, exactly as it is for any
hypervisor. The workspace directory is the shared surface: anything the host
places there is readable by the guest, and anything the guest writes there is
immediately visible to the host.

**Content-addressed snapshots.** `snapshot()` freezes the workspace into a
*canonicalised image*, streams it into the CAS store (`.sdd/cas`, see
[cas-store.md](./cas-store.md)), and returns the **SHA-256 digest** as the
snapshot id. The image is a tar with sorted paths, zeroed mtimes/uids, real
file-permission bits, and host-independent symlink targets - a pure function
of the tree, so byte-identical on any host and under any process identity.
Special files are dropped from the payload, but their presence is recorded so
they cannot silently collide. `resume(digest)` reads the blob back with integrity
verification on, so a tampered snapshot fails its CAS check
(`CASIntegrityError`) *before* it can boot. Images are full and
self-contained, so a resume can never be confused about which base it
forked from. Memory snapshots are deliberately out of scope: a memory
image is never byte-reproducible (kernel timers, entropy, page/ASLR
ordering), which would make the determinism guarantee below impossible.

**Fork-and-race** (`src/bernstein/core/sandbox/fork_race.py`).
`fork_race()` resumes K candidates from *one* content-addressed base
digest, runs each to a terminal snapshot, and picks the winner with the
existing deterministic ranker (`select_winner` → TOPSIS) — **no LLM in the
selection path**. Determinism is engineered end to end: candidates are
sorted by `task_id` *before* ranking (float sums are order-sensitive), and
the pinned ranking profile excludes any wall-clock axis.

**Selection receipt** (`src/bernstein/core/sandbox/selection_receipt.py`).
The output is a `SelectionReceipt`: canonical JSON, Ed25519-signed, binding
`{base_snapshot_digest, candidates[{task_id, terminal_snapshot_digest,
score_vector, isolation}], winner_task_id, winner_snapshot_digest,
ranker_profile, loser_snapshot_digests[]}`. The signed body carries **no**
wall-clock, run id, or chain position, so running the same race twice
produces a **byte-identical** signed receipt. Losing branches are recorded
as lineage siblings, and the receipt is appended to the HMAC-chained audit
log in a single serialised call (chain-position binding lives in that
wrapper entry, not in the receipt body).

**CLI.**

```bash
# Fork K candidates from a base snapshot; emits a signed receipt.
bernstein sandbox fork-race --base <sha256> --k 3 --cmd 'make test' --out receipt.json

# Verify a receipt: Ed25519 signature + re-hash base + winner + every loser
# against CAS. Proves signed + CAS-intact; NOT that it was chain-appended
# (that is the audit log's own verify).
bernstein sandbox receipt verify receipt.json

# Anchor the check to a known signer. WITHOUT this the signature is only
# checked for self-consistency (a receipt re-signed under any key still
# passes) - so an unanchored verify never exits 0.
bernstein sandbox receipt verify receipt.json --expected-keyid <keyid>
```

**Exit codes.** `receipt verify` distinguishes every outcome so a CLI-scripted
gate can branch on them; the same verdict is computed once (`verify_receipt_full`
→ `FullReceiptVerdict`) and shared by the CLI and the library, so the two can
never disagree. A malformed or unreadable receipt file yields a clean
diagnosable error, never a traceback.

| Code | Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `verified` | Anchored to the expected signer, signature + consistency intact, and every named blob (base + winner + losers) re-hashed intact against CAS. |
| 1 | `failed` | Bad signature/consistency, a **tampered** blob (present, wrong hash), or a **malformed** digest field. Highest precedence — an integrity alarm. |
| 4 | `unreadable` | A named blob could not be read on this host (permissions, or an anomalous symlink the verifier refuses to dereference). A property of the reader, not the record. |
| 2 | `incomplete` | A named blob is **absent** from CAS (GC / retention / restart). An ordinary operational event, never conflated with tampering. |
| 3 | `unanchored` | Signature + blobs check out, but `--expected-keyid` was omitted or empty (an unset env var counts as empty), so *whose* key signed it is unproven. |

Precedence when several apply: `failed` > `unreadable` > `incomplete` (absent) > `unanchored` > `verified`.

**Symlink refusal, and where it stops.** A CAS blob is read by walking the store
one path component at a time, each open carrying `O_NOFOLLOW`, so a symlink
planted at the blob *or* at the shard directory above it is refused by the open
itself rather than by a check that could be raced. The store root is exempt on
purpose: pointing it at another volume is operator configuration, not an attack.
The refusal needs `os.open` to accept `dir_fd` and the platform to define
`O_NOFOLLOW`. **It is POSIX-only.** Windows has neither, and there the read
falls back to a single open of the joined path that refuses **nothing** — not
the parents, not the final component. Read that as the absence of a guard
rather than a weaker one: a Windows junction is followed exactly as it was
before. A refused symlink is `unreadable` (exit 4) on every platform that can
refuse it; it is never reported as `absent`, which would clear the record of a
suspicion the reader cannot rule out.

Symlinks are not the only way to stall a reader, so the blob open also refuses
anything that is not a regular file, opening non-blocking and checking the type
on the descriptor. A FIFO planted at a blob's own name needs no link at all,
and would otherwise block the read until a writer appeared.

The same anchored walk protects direct reads of the `.meta.json` sidecar beside
each blob, including the reads used by `list_entries`. This prevents a shard or
sidecar symlink from redirecting the file open, but it does **not** authenticate
the metadata: unlike the blob, the sidecar is not content-addressed and has no
digest to verify. Treat its fields as descriptive, not as evidence.

On POSIX, anchoring a metadata read adds descriptor opens for the store root and
shard plus a regular-file check before reading the sidecar. This small per-read
cost is accepted so a future metadata consumer cannot silently inherit an
unanchored path. Windows retains the single-open fallback described above.

`fork-race` requires a microVM-capable host; on an unsupported host it
fails loudly. The determinism/tamper guarantees are validated
host-independently over the `FakeMonitor` (see
`tests/unit/sandbox/test_fork_race.py`). The real libkrun boot/exec/freeze
round trip is covered by the host-gated
`tests/integration/sandbox/test_microvm_libkrun.py` (opt in with
`BERNSTEIN_MICROVM_LIBKRUN_INTEGRATION=1` on a host that satisfies the
requirements above). The Firecracker path is covered by the KVM-gated
`tests/integration/sandbox/test_microvm_firecracker.py`. The refusal-invariant
assertions in both files run everywhere.

## `plan.yaml` extension

```yaml
stages:
  - name: risky-execution
    sandbox:
      backend: docker          # worktree (default), docker, e2b, modal, or a plugin name
      options:
        image: python:3.13-slim
        memory_mb: 2048
        timeout_seconds: 1800
    steps:
      - title: "Run untrusted code analysis"
        role: security
        cli: claude
```

`sandbox:` is entirely optional. When omitted the stage runs in the
worktree backend - byte-identical to the pre-pluggable-sandbox
behaviour.

## Registering a custom backend

Plugin authors declare an entry point in their own `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."bernstein.sandbox_backends"]
mybackend = "my_package.sandbox:MySandboxBackend"
```

On next process start the registry picks the entry up automatically.
`bernstein agents sandbox-backends` lists every installed backend
with its capability set so operators can verify registration.

Third-party backends must:

1. Provide `name` and `capabilities` class attributes.
2. Implement `create`, `resume`, and `destroy` as coroutines.
3. Pass the conformance suite at
   `bernstein.core.sandbox.conformance.SandboxBackendConformance`.
4. Import provider SDKs lazily (inside methods or behind
   `TYPE_CHECKING`) so importing the backend module never crashes on
   a missing SDK.

## Integration

- `SandboxBackend` / `SandboxSession` / `SandboxCapability` /
  `WorkspaceManifest` live in `src/bernstein/core/sandbox/`.
- First-party backends ship in core (worktree, docker, microvm, blaxel,
  daytona, runloop, vercel); e2b and modal ship as optional extras.
- `AgentSpawner` accepts an optional `sandbox_session` parameter; when
  `None` it falls back to the direct-worktree path.
- `bernstein agents sandbox-backends` lists installed backends.
- `plan.yaml` accepts an optional `sandbox:` block per stage.

## Observability

Each backend create/destroy cycle emits WAL + Prometheus metrics:

- `sandbox_session_created{backend=..., session_id=...}`
- `sandbox_session_destroyed{backend=..., duration_seconds=...}`
- `sandbox_exec_count{backend=..., exit_code=...}`

## Conformance

`SandboxBackendConformance` (in
`src/bernstein/core/sandbox/conformance.py`) is a parametrised pytest
class any backend can subclass to get a complete protocol test
coverage suite. Backends declaring `SANDBOX_CAPABILITY.SNAPSHOT`
additionally get the snapshot/resume round-trip test automatically.

The worktree backend runs the conformance suite in unit tests
(`tests/unit/sandbox/test_backend_protocol.py`). Docker / E2B /
Modal conformance lives under `tests/integration/sandbox/`; those
tests auto-skip without a live daemon or provider credentials.

## Security considerations

- `worktree` does **not** isolate at the kernel level. If you need
  to run untrusted code you must choose a sandboxed backend.
- An artifact-mode task (issue #2996) runs in a plain directory under
  `.sdd/workspaces/` instead of a git worktree. The same caveat applies:
  that directory is working-directory separation, not kernel-level
  isolation - choose a sandboxed backend for untrusted code regardless
  of a task's output mode.
- `docker` should be run with `network_disabled=True` for untrusted
  workloads; the default leaves network enabled because most agent
  tasks legitimately need outbound HTTP.
- `e2b` and `modal` run untrusted code by design; their isolation
  posture is the provider's responsibility.
- Snapshot IDs are opaque to callers but may contain sensitive
  state. Do not log them at INFO level without redaction.
